our topic today ?
Uh , yeah ,
something about the school system here .
Right ,
and now I 'm sort of , do n't know if this an advantage or disadvantage .
My wife 's a school teacher
so ,
Well , then , I 'll , uh , I 'll walk softly .
No .
You go right ahead because I ,
have a lot of strong opinions on it , too .
My wife teaches seventh grade ,
and , you know , there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system .
I think the ,
I do n't think the teachers get enough support , quite honestly .
Yeah .
But , uh , for example , my wife , she has kids that are on drugs ,
and , of course , like everyone , she has kids that get pregnant even , even in the seventh grade .
What school system does she teach in ?
Plano School System .
Oh , wow .
But to give you an example , uh , you know , one of her kids will come in and he 's , you could tell he was just bombed out on drugs ,
and , uh , she sends him to the principal 's office ,
and the principal sends him right back , or her right back , and says , Hey , your problem , you take care of it .
You 're not allowed to send them home .
You know , if you do that , then your allocation 's cut from the state or the feds or whatever ,
your , your ,
you have to have a certain amount of kids in your class every day ,
and , it 's , it 's , it 's a numbers game .
I do n't think that 's right , if they 're , especially if they 're interrupting the class and preventing other kids from learning .
Well , I think it 's more of a ,
there 's a bigger problem here than , uh , than discipline in the schools .
I think it gets back to the , uh , parental participation into the program .
Yes .
Um , to give you an example , both of my children are in the academy system in the Garland School District ,
and it 's a public system , however , you 'd think that it was a private school , because I take it , the best teachers and the best students ,
they 're taking top three percent that have tested out , you know , in the district and , uh , put them in this academy system ,
and to get into the system 's very difficult .
But once you 're in , uh , they have , they have self-paced programs ,
and so you have students that want to learn
and , uh , you have teachers that want to teach ,
and you have parents that are really interested in the children ,
and basically , uh , there 's probably some discrimination if you want to say that --
Sure .
-- uh , because most of the people that are in the academy system , uh , are Caucasian , and , because you have to test into the system .
Sure .
And most of ,
that 's not all true ,
but I 'm saying a large percentage of them are ,
and also the other large percentage is is that all the parents just about , of these kids , uh , have college degrees , at least one parent does .
And so there 's ,
I think that , uh , that 's my justification for saying that the parents that are , that are pushing their children at home , even if they do n't know what their children are learning , they 're , they 're saying do your homework , let me see it , do n't get in trouble at school or we 're going to be all over you .
Oh , yeah .
My son had such a tough time in , uh , the school he went to
but , there was through ,
it was n't all the school 's fault ,
it was his fault also ,
but we put him in a private school in Richardson ,
and that , that cost more ,
that was five thousand dollars a semester for three semesters ,
that was more than his college tuition was --
Yeah
.
-- but , uh , it had to be done ,
at least it took care of him and , uh , threw him in a good learning situation where he did participate and , uh , want to learn something .
But I 'll tell you what , there 's a , there , there are a few faults , to say the least , in the school systems today .
Yeah .
I think what we 've done is , um , um , especially looking at , um , the South Dallas area , is that we 're trying to bring the education level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed .
Yeah ,
I think we have that problem dealing in most areas , which is unfortunate .
And , um , that also probably crosses over into business , because now , businesses also say that if you 're not , do n't have the proper education , uh , including , uh , exposure to high tech fields --
You bet .
-- such as computer technology , if you ca n't use a computer today and do word processing and do , uh , data base management and do , I forget all the other stuff , financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job , uh , you ca n't function --
You bet .
-- you know .
MUMBLEx .
So I think that the school system proliferates over to the business world
and the business world then says , we 're not going to pay you , unless you have the education ,
and then educ- ,
and then , then we , what we 've done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself .
Sure .
Well , teachers , you know , they have a , a tough row to hoe , so to speak , they just , always fighting the system .
I do n't know if it 's better than any ,
you know , we came down to Texas from the , uh , New York area ,
we were there for a short time ,
but my wife is from New York ,
and she was born and raised there , and educated there , college and everything ,
and I think , you know , the schools in the east are really a whole lot better than the schools in the south , I do n't care where you 're from .
And they , they ,
I do n't know if they learn more ,
but they certainly , uh , they have a tendency to learn more ,
and in that part of the country there is all nationalities ,
Alright Allen .
Uh , the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of American women in the past several generations and you know , in their , the society we live in .
What do you think has occurred there ?
Well , I think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home .
That 's probably one of the major changes I see over the last period of time .
Uh-huh .
But are , are they being given the full honor for the work they are doing and for the , uh , oh my gosh , I ca n't think of the word , but for the , what they have to accept that 's they are responsible for .
Uh , responsibilities is what I am trying to say .
Oh , I do n't think so .
I think it has come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities --
Uh-huh .
-- but I still think in lots of job markets they are not treated as equals .
In other words , in some respects the other direction , in some job markets they do n't really want to be treated as equals .
By the same token , most , in most cases , women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who have been there before , but at lower salaries .
Yes
I think that 's --
Is that right and wrong ?
-- generally speaking , pretty true .
And I think that 's what we really ought to look at that , going is , if they are going to do equal work they ought to get equal pay .
Yes .
And that , uh , they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions --
Uh-huh .
-- and I do n't think that we have gotten there yet .
Yeah .
Well , what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years ?
Any individual thing --
Oh , boy .
-- or is it just a general switch over ?
I think it 's generally that switch over .
And , and I think that switch over has been more in the work force .
I do n't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force .
I think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home --
Uh-huh .
-- that the husband is having them , on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home .
So they have one and three quarters jobs now . Whereas the husbands have one and a quarter .
I have a feeling that business with the woman working out at the same level of responsibility as their husband sort of tears into their social or their loving relationship .
Yeah .
In that , uh , the , the lady needs to stand up for what she has made and her own rights and has a right to do so
and this upsets the man because we have always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household .
So do you think that is going to be uh , difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other --
Yes .
-- in the future years ?
Yeah .
I think also in terms of parenting .
I think there is going to be some increasing problem because I think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting
and I am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it .
Uh-huh .
So I think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units .
Well , do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation ,
specifically ?
Well , I , I think one of the things that always happens is I think is when the one end wh- , you know were moving out to the end where a lot of women will be at work --
Uh-huh .
-- and then I think we are starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties
and so the opinion of this career thing is n't all that it is cracked up to be
and I want to go back and do something else .
I think we will probably see the sw- , pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit .
Uh-huh .
Also , much of it is driven by economics right now .
Yes .
People have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in .
Well , I actually , mo- ,
a lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that 's what everybody else assumes they are going to get .
Yeah .
And the people .
Well , how do you feel about women in , uh , armed services ?
Well , I think they ought to have the right .
I have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife going to com- , or my wife and my daughter going into combat --
Yeah .
-- but I have problems with men doing that
and I guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it .
Um .
It 's nothing I would be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for it .
Yeah .
I somehow ca n't do that
I ,
was brought up in the ages where the ladies were kept home , safe , secure , and made happy
and the men went out and took responsibility of earning the money , bringing in whatever they needed and protected the household
and it , it really still bothers me .
I spent plenty of years in the service ,
but it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or actually out in places where there is two or three of them there and five hundred men around .
I mean how are they going to protect themselves so to speak .
I agree .
It puts them in a very bad situation .
I , I really do n't go for that .
I think one of the other things that concern , has concerned me a little bit ,
and I think I see some change in attitudes there .
My wife happens to be a wife who has chosen to stay at home --
Uh-huh .
-- and there 's , uh , has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who did n't have much intelligence --
Yep .
-- because if she did she would be out in the work force , uh , fulfilling herself .
Well , that 's not fair . Because I can tell you one thing , stay home sometime and start doing some of those jobs that she 's been handling
and you 're going to learn there is a lot of responsibility just keeping the home going .
And I hope we reach the point where whatever women chose to do , that 's acceptable .
Yeah .
If they chose to go into the work force that 's okay .
Yeah .
If they chose not to , that 's acceptable .
And if they go into the work force , they should be treated as nicely --
As equals .
-- as , as well as a man or any other person .
And , uh , not ,
All right .
Okay ,
so what do you think of the Giants ?
Uh , I like the Giants .
They got , uh ,
I probably did n't get into baseball until maybe , maybe three years ago really --
Yeah .
-- so , uh , but I , I just like the Giants .
I do n't , I do n't know why .
I really got into them .
I read , uh , Dave Dreveki 's book --
Oh , yeah .
-- his autobiography --
Yeah --
-- and ,
-- was n't that something of him .
Yeah ,
that , that was incredible .
Yeah ,
that 's really a ,
really proud of him though , the way he 's , you know .
The way he handled that entire situation , there .
Yeah ,
really , you know .
But , I just think the Giants have a good team .
They , they got all , you know ,
they 're , they 're , they 're real balanced out .
They got real good pitching ,
and they got the hitting to go along with it .
So .
Yeah ,
I just do n't understand why they 're not right up there on the top --
Yeah ,
they just --
-- you know .
-- they need that , I think they just need that one , one element to push them over the top , you know .
I do n't really know what it is ,
but , but every team that 's , that 's really good seems ,
you know , like the A -s had , they had , they just had it all that one year .
So .
Yeah ,
um I was mostly an A -s fan , you know .
I had been to more games at the A -s than I have in the Giants --
Yeah .
-- because , uh , I lived in Oakland --
Yeah .
-- you know , for some time .
But , uh , I still like the Giants , though , you know .
Yeah ,
if you 're a fan you got to stay with the team any way , you know , you --
Yeah ,
right .
-- good and the bad
but . It 's , it 's kind of hard .
I still , basically , the , the ,
me and all my friends around here , since we do n't have anywhere ,
I mean , we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams ,
but since , no- ,
me , none of me and my friends are really , really like either one of those teams ,
so we , uh --
Uh-huh .
-- about , about the most baseball we get is either T V or we play it on Nintendo .
We play R B I baseball on Nintendo
so .
Yeah ,
right ,
right .
So that 's just , you know , that 's small town trying to make it through the --
Yeah .
-- not being around it really ,
but .
Yeah ,
right .
Well , I prefer ba- , uh , football --
Yeah .
-- over baseball ,
but , uh .
Yeah ,
so do I ,
but baseball is still --
Yeah ,
it 's .
-- you got , you got to do something when football ai n't on .
So ,
So , hot dogs , baseball and apple pie . Huh .
Yeah ,
exactly .
This is America ,
so .
Yeah ,
um .
But .
So what do you think is going to happen this year to the teams ?
Uh , I do n't know , it 's hard to say .
I have n't really , really ,
you have to just keep up with everything in the off- season .
It 's kind of hard to do ,
at least , you know , --
I know .
-- you have to read the paper and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and , and all that ,
but , like I say , if they can , if they can get that one element that they were missing , I think the Giants can do it .
Yeah ,
well , the Giants are .
They just ,
I do n't ,
yeah
I do n't really know about the A -s .
I do n't like the A -s , uh , matter of fact I ca n't stand the Oakland A -s .
Just because they have , uh , you know , they 've got their Jose Canseco and , and all the attitude that goes along with that , you know .
They kind of .
Yeah ,
makes you sick , does n't it ?
Yeah .
You hear what , you hear what , you hear what he did .
Yes .
He ramming his wife 's car ,
and I was like , yeah .
He 's like a little bitty kid , huh .
Yeah ,
he 's just a , a , a little boy with a lot of money .
So .
Yeah
.
That 's just ,
you know , but .
Yeah ,
well , I guess the Giants or , might move away from San Francisco , it sounds like .
Yeah ,
I 've heard , I 've heard talk about that .
You know , uh , they wo n't be that far away ,
but San Francisco will be hurting , anyhow .
Yeah ,
they 're not going to be happy about it .
You know .
But I hope they can do good .
I mean , that 's just ,
I think they 're a good team . That just need that one , one little thing to push them over .
I do n't know exactly what it is .
They got ,
they 're pretty balanced out all the way through .
It just might be the drive , you know --
Uh-huh .
-- more than anything else ,
they just , they probably just need something to push them --
Uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
-- because I , that 's , that 's the only thing I can see that 's holding them back , is the ambition to do it .
Or somebody basically ,
maybe they just need everybody to tell them they ca n't do it .
Maybe that 's what , you know , that 's what some teams need .
Look at the Twins going from worst to first .
I know , is n't that something --
Yeah ,
my roommate --
-- I could n't believe that , huh .
-- my roommate 's a Twins fan , for forever ,
so , he had his year this year ,
so .
Yeah ,
I just , it .
We got pre- , we , we got into that a whole bunch .
Uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
That was a , that was a series to remember , for sure .
Uh-huh .
So I saw all seven games of that ,
so .
Uh-huh .
That was definitely worth watching .
Yeah ,
yeah ,
I could n't believe that , you know .
Yeah .
I do n't , uh ,
there was Braves in that chanting that they had .
That would drive you up a wall .
Yeah
they ,
every team with the Indians been doing that now .
You know .
I ca n't figure out why .
You have to figure out why they 're all doing that , I 'm like , it 's does n't work , it 's obvious it does n't work because the , you know --
Yeah ,
well , you 're right .
-- the Braves , Braves did n't win ,
so , uh , why keep on doing something that did n't work ,
but --
Yeah ,
yeah .
-- I do n't know .
Yeah .
I was , I was kind of surprised that we were going to talk about baseball ,
and I get a woman 's voice .
I was ,
I was , I was thinking , uh-huh ,
I talked to a guy named Vinny last night about fixing your car ,
so .
Oh , really ?
Yeah ,
I got , I called , got a call the other night about , uh , fixing your automobile up ,
so .
Uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
Well , baseball 's baseball .
Yeah ,
right .
It 's kind of ,
I do n't know , it 's kind of odd they pick ,
do you pick the topic or does the computer ?
No ,
uh , they give you a list of things that you want ,
Uh , Greg ,
uh , I , I 'm not familiar .
I think , uh , you guys in Indiana , do n't you have the , the death penalty ?
Yeah ,
we do have the death penalty here .
It 's not exercised very often ,
but we do have it .
Uh-huh .
I believe it ,
I ca n't even remember the last execution we had here actually .
Uh-huh .
Uh , personally I 'm in favor of capital punishment .
I know there 's a lot of , lot of problems with it ,
but , uh --
Uh-huh .
-- seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that , that the person just , I feel , does n't deserve to live , does n't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in , in prison for life .
Right .
But , I know there 's a lot of problems with that , like , well , they say , okay , if you declare someone , put them on death row and execute them , well , then ten years later you find out that he really did n't do it , then that life was wasted ,
but --
Uh-huh .
-- just seems like in some cases that it 's a , it 's a good policy .
Uh-huh .
Uh , I , I tend to agree with you ,
uh , I 've changed my views over , uh , e- , even within the last few years , uh , to be honest .
Uh , uh , when I was in coll- , when I was an undergraduate , I was a member of Amnesty International --
Uh-huh .
-- and , uh , and , of course , at that time , you know , I thought , uh , uh , it was stupid to kill anybody for , uh ,
you know , that
the eye for an eye was a stupid argument .
Right .
But the , uh , the more ,
now I live in downtown Dallas ,
and I , uh , --
Right .
-- you know , I 've seen , uh , I 've seen cases on , in the news and all where , where , you know , uh , a , a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder .
Right .
I think that maybe , uh , a good solution to capital punishment might be , uh , reserve it solely for , uh , repeat offenders of a crime like , uh , murder .
That 's a , that 's a thought that I had never really had on that --
Yeah ,
uh .
-- which seems pretty sensible .
Yeah ,
it seems sensible and failsafe .
I , I , uh , I do n't ,
you know , not completely failsafe ,
but if a man 's convicted of two murders , uh , you know , there 's a pretty good chance that something 's wrong .
Right .
Uh I also , uh ,
to tell you how liberal I have turned , uh , toward this , or , or , or whatever side that is --
Right .
Yeah .
-- I 've kind of chosen , uh , I believe it that , uh , big time drug importers , like , uh , say Noriega for example --
Uh-huh .
-- that these people need to be , uh , eliminated , uh --
Uh-huh .
-- from society ,
and I think , I think the death penalty is the best choice for those people , because , uh , really any kind of , uh , uh , jail sentence for them is just another chance to , uh , create another power structure .
Yeah ,
you 're , you 're right there .
Uh , I gue ,
basically my views , I guess they tend to be more economically oriented --
Uh-huh .
-- in that I just , you know , they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars , taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail --
Right .
-- when they 're going to be there for life , they 're never going to be rehabilitated .
Right .
I mean , I do n't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with --
Right .
-- so to me I 'm paying taxes , you know , twenty percent of my check or whatever --
Uh-huh .
-- to keep somebody alive who I , in my mind should n't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society ,
so I , I 'm all in favor of it .
Uh-huh .
Well , uh , do you , uh ,
are there cases where you think that , that , uh , the capital , the capital punishment should n't be , uh , uh , sentenced ?
Well , I , I really do n't know on that question .
It just seems like ,
for instance , the Jeffrey Dahlmer case . I mean , I do n't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society .
I hope the guy never gets back out on the streets --
Uh-huh .
-- and in that case , Wisconsin does n't have a death penalty ,
so he 's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment --
Right .
-- and I think that , that he should not be allowed to live ,
but , you know , then you 're kind of playing God --
That 's true ,
yeah .
-- which is n- , never a good thing to do .
Right .
But cases where I think the death penalty should be withheld , uh , not really that I can think of .
I , I would , I would be in favor of the death penalty in things like , you know , murders , and like you said , repeat murders or --
Uh-huh .
-- serial killers --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , I do n't really agree with the , uh , death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that .
I think that they 're , they 're operating on a more ,
I mean , I know that they 're causing massive problems in society up here ,
but I do n't really think that , that it 's , it 's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you do n't deserve to live , because --
Right .
-- they 're feeding our consumer needs .
Sure ,
yeah ,
I understand , I understand your point .
Yeah .
Uh , of course , you know , with , uh , with , with Dahlmer now , uh , you , you realize that Ohi- , I think it 's Ohio , uh , gets to try him next
and --
Uh-huh .
-- they do have the death penalty .
Yeah .
Yeah ,
so , uh , that was a curious case .
I .
Yeah ,
that is very curious .
Uh , uh , something is sort of nightmarish --
Yeah .
-- to say the least .
That 's , that 's right .
Uh , well , here in Texas we , uh ,
I think even , even this last week , last week they had another , they , uh ,
you know , they use their capital punishment by lethal injection , uh , uh ,
Steve , this is ,
like I mentioned , Brian and I guess we 're going to want to be talking about child care .
Uh , do you have any experience in , uh , finding child care ?
Well , ourselves , we have , I guess never had to look for child care .
Uh-huh .
Our kids are now fourteen and eighteen .
But , uh , and so , you know , you go back those many years and , uh , we did n't do it very much .
Uh-huh .
We , I guess , we were in a situation where we did n't need to be looking at , uh , two family income at the time .
Uh-huh .
And our kids were older .
But I 've had to deal with , uh , you know , friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing .
Right .
Uh , so it ,
my involvement has n't been direct
but still have been , you know , certainly exposed to criteria people are using .
Uh-huh .
How about yourself ?
Well , uh , we 're kind of lucky .
I , I 'm , uh , I 'm working .
My wife is n't working
and she is taking care of the kids also .
And , and so we have n't had to look for child care either which has been very nice .
But I do have , like you mentioned , a lot of friends , a lot of , uh , co-workers and associates that are looking for child care
and some of the things that they 're very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care . Uh , what kind of , you know , uh , guidance counselor to student or , you know , uh , adult to child relationship .
How many --
Right .
-- you know , you do n't want to have thirty or forty kids and only one adult .
Then --
Right .
-- uh , something happens and the adult would n't be able to , uh , accommodate or take care of the kids very well .
Right .
And , uh , they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not just playing around all the time .
So , you know , depends also upon the , the level of the child .
We , uh , we , uh , take a very close look at finding a , a preschool , a good preschool for our kid .
Uh-huh .
And I kind of relate that to that in , in making sure that the , the , uh , teachers are very well educated themselves . They have a good curriculum and that they 're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them .
And it 's very important , I feel , uh , that the kids interact with other children also .
It 's a , it 's a good way to develop --
Yeah .
-- relationships with other kids their age and , uh , get to know and work with kids .
So . I do n't know . I , I guess we 're kind of in the same boat .
We have n't had to look very carefully for child care .
Yeah .
I , I kind of think that , uh , you know , some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care .
Uh-huh .
But even , you know , here . I guess we have in one sense two forms of , uh , child care .
There 's where individuals will in one , primarily babysit --
Uh-huh .
-- children in their own home .
And that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to , maybe , seven or eight children .
Uh-huh .
And then otherwise , there will be
, the majority are co-operative day-cares .
Uh , people form a co-op and , uh , parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours .
Frequently , they will hire staff to be at the day-care
and the emphasis is primarily , uh , someplace for the children to be .
Uh-huh .
But , at the same time , there 's some fairly good training programs and , and some of them formal two year programs .
Right ,
right .
Uh , so that ,
you know , there is some definite , uh , creative play , good social interaction , that kind of thing .
I think it 's , uh , important . Like you mentioned , that 's a good idea on the , uh , parent co-op because , uh , I 'm very concerned about the welfare of my kids
and I do n't want to just take them to somebody I pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere .
I want to trust the people .
Yeah .
And , uh , you know , you hear in the newspa- , you hear on the T V and you read the newspaper quite often of , of people that , you know , do n't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of ,
so . And hope to never get into that situation where we have to , have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children .
And hope that we can stay in this situation for awhile .
So .
Yeah .
You know , we 've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here --
Uh-huh .
-- and I guess , you know , it , are ,
it 's , uh , typically , uh , whether it 's been child care in a home --
Uh-huh .
-- or in a larger situation where actually it 's more of an institution .
And you 've actually got children that most people would consider problem children
and it 's not , and it 's more of a group home rather than --
Yeah .
-- actually day-care s- , type of facility .
That 's true ,
that 's true .
Uh .
Well , Steven , it 's been ,
Well , I 'm ,
are you there ?
Yes ,
yes .
Okay .
I 'm sure that I probably , uh , prescribe to different magazines ones that you do .
I take DOLL READER and DOLL WORLD .
Different set .
Because I collect dolls .
Uh , I also take BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS .
Uh-huh .
I like that .
And then , uh , my husband , he just , uh , subscribed to a wood ,
he just started a woodwork
so he just sent away to get some woodworking books .
Oh .
MUMBLEx .
So what kind do you , uh , get ?
Well I have a bunch of computer journals --
Uh-huh .
-- because I 'm in computer science
but beyond that , uh , lately I 've been reading ,
I 've always liked the NEW YORKER .
Uh-huh .
And lately I 've been picking up some of the travel , uh , both trade magazines and just the general travel magazines .
Uh-huh .
Uh , trying to keep up on what 's going on .
MUMBLEx my --
Is it ,
-- wife also gets a lot of the food magazines . BON APPETITE , and FOOD AND WINE and GOURMET .
Yeah ,
I used to take that .
Right .
Yeah .
And she still likes to get TIME --
Yeah .
-- which I 've never liked very much
but she seems to .
Yeah .
I do n't ,
I ,
if I , you know , if I happen to find it , I 'll go ahead and read it someplace , you know , if I 'm in a doctor 's office or something like that
but other than that I never , I never liked that really .
Do you read a newspaper ?
I read my newspaper .
I can hardly wait in the mornings for the newspaper --
Yeah .
-- to get here , you know .
So I do like to read the newspaper . Uh , even this little newspaper that Patterson puts out .
In fact , it puts it out on Tuesdays and Thursdays . I can hardly wait to get that to get the local news .
But , uh , other than that , magazines , I do n't know . There 's so much advertising in them anymore .
Some of them I used to get for the advertising . Like BYTE magazine which is , uh , one of the --
Oh , okay .
-- larger computer ones .
I have n't bought it now for about eight years .
Uh-huh .
But when I used to get it , it was about five hundred pages , about three hundred of them advertising .
Huh .
Because that was interesting . I think a lot of the trade magazines are like that .
Uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
That , that half the fun is finding out what all the products are .
Uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
But , you know , some of the get ridiculous .
TRAVEL AND LEISURE , all of the AMERICAN EXPRESS magazines --
Uh-huh .
-- so TRAVEL AND LEISURE , FOOD AND WINE and I think they have some others , uh , certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for
and ,
it is , it 's clear that , I , I 've bought some of these through wholesalers
and they do n't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription , they 're making everything on ads .
Yeah ,
right ,
right .
Yeah ,
well I , I only , you know , subscribe to the things I 'm interested in .
I used to be into coin collecting
so I used to get the coin magazine , the paper actually is what it was , you know .
I used to get that .
So now that I 'm into dolls , that 's about --
Uh-huh .
-- all I really , really want , you know .
Have you ever , uh , read or subscribe to CONSUMER REPORTS for any length of time ?
No ,
huh-uh .
Uh , I think they 're interesting .
But not worth it .
Yeah
.
I , I 've always had this ,
one of the reasons I like just to pick up magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different perspective .
Uh-huh .
So I 've always had this problem with CONSUMER REPORTS that in the areas that I know a lot about , I disagree with them .
Uh-huh .
And I always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything ,
or , or what 's going on .
Uh-huh .
So I , like I 've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent , uh , organization magazines
and it 's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective .
Uh , you know , their major interest is in commissions
and , you know , there 's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines .
Their major talk is about , you know , commissions and commission rebates and how they wo n't suggest hotels to people if the commission 's not a , the full ten percent or whatever it is
and --
Uh-huh .
-- it gives you a different perspective on what people do .
Uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
Well those travel magazines , are that , more or less , show you different countries that you could go to
or ,
Uh , some of them .
The , the general travel magazines do .
I do n't tend to read it for that .
Uh-huh .
Because I do n't expect to be traveling overseas in , in the future for quite awhile .
Uh-huh .
But I , I usually just read through the sections on , on domestic stuff .
Uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
Okay .
Well I do n't know any other magazines I could talk to you about .
No .
Uh , I do n't take anymore than that .
Yeah .
I do n't take much more in myself .
You know , so .
Okay .
Well I guess that will be it then
and ,
Okay ,
nice talking to you .
Been on the line for awhile .
I almost forgot what the topic was .
Okay .
Uh , based ,
Uh , but I know what it is .
Oh , okay .
Good .
Uh , let me see .
I , I , I , I , I 'm kind of ,
I do n't ,
you know , I 'm , I 'm kind of in the middle .
I , I think it 's a great idea --
Uh-huh .
-- but when it comes to me , it 's like , almost an insult , you know ,
so it 's
I , I 've come from the teaching field .
Right .
So do I .
So , so it 's just like I do n't know . I , I guess , I guess I 'd have to go with , uh ,
I , I , I 'd be for it .
Uh-huh .
You know .
But , uh , you know , I , I , I do n't know . It 's just kind of a , kind of a delicate subject I guess .
But I , I , I would , I would probably go for , for going ahead and doing it , you know . If it 's got to be done for everyone .
Right .
I think if it 's got to be done for one person in the company , it should be random testing , it should be for everybody .
Right .
You know , when they answer the company , I think it 'll make it a lot easier --
Right .
-- and they 'd run into less problems .
Yeah .
Because , uh ,
I do n't know , I come from the teaching field too
and it sort of , uh ,
it 's a pro and a con ty- ,
I do n't know where to stand on it .
Yeah .
I 'm more or less , if they told me I had to well then fine ,
but --
Yeah .
-- if , you know , if they made me then I 'd probably ,
if I had my druthers I 'd probably say well no
you know just this ,
Yeah .
You kind of goes into your privacy
and --
Right .
-- you know , but I guess if they ,
you know , you know , there 's , uh ,
I guess there 's some companies that are n't , that are doing it .
Uh-huh .
And it , it seems to be working out
so ,
Yeah ,
I think it 's , it 's , what they 're basically trying to do , I do n't know up here in Massachusetts anyhow , what they 're basically trying to do is , uh , oh gosh , uh , any people who had di- , tested positively , getting them into a drug program .
Yeah .
Or rehab program .
Right .
And , uh , anybody who , uh , gee , is , you know , di- , does n't accept the rehab program then they 're , more or less , getting laid off .
See , that 's hard .
I , I think that 's really hard to because , you know , you never know . I do n't know , it ,
that 's a ,
it 's really weird issue .
I 'm sort of --
Yeah .
-- on the fence about it .
Yeah .
But I ,
you know , that , that 's what 's they 're coming across as is some of the companies anyhow .
Oh , we can get you into a drug program .
But then you wear that stigma --
Yeah .
-- you know .
Yeah .
Where , uh , like a lot of people are saying , well I only smoked a joint last night , I do n't have any problems you know .
Yeah .
Or something like that ,
yeah .
Then I kind of hear it goes into like , uh ,
this is just something I 've heard that it kind of goes into like , uh , just your off the counter medication that you could be taking for a cold . That it kind of affects that too .
Right .
Anything with an- , a ,
you know , if you drink a lot of caffeine or ,
Oh , I did n't know that .
Yeah ,
somebody was saying , telling me if you drink it in ,
you know , an awful lot of caffeine , that that can show up as a positive test .
Um .
I know I 'm an epileptic
so I 'd probably test positive and --
Yeah .
See things like that
so ,
-- and then I 'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system , you know .
Yeah .
And a lot of times , those are the things I do n't like to disclose to an employer because then they do n't want to have anything to do with you .
Right ,
right .
Uh-huh .
You know , it 's very personal .
I would n't want to have it disclosed because --
See that 's ,
-- then I 'd always wonder if they fired me , you know , why did you fire me .
Yeah .
That 's where I kind of get into ,
cause it kind of gets into your personal life , you know .
And --
Uh-huh .
-- MUMBLEx wha- , what 's kind of next .
Yeah .
It , it hits me as the Orwell thing . Big brother is watching .
The what ?
Orwell .
Huh .
And , you know , his book . Brig , big brother is watching .
Oh .
You know , you 're being controlled .
Yeah .
That type of deal
and I sh- ,
I do n't really , you know , I do n't know . Seems awful strange .
I 'd hate to have to ,
if I had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who did n't --
Right .
-- I 'd probably take the company who did n't ?
Yeah
.
Because I feel there 'd be more trust in the employee .
Right .
But I can understand why they need it with all the , you know , train accidents and everything else .
So do you think they 'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually ?
I kind of think they will .
I think they will too because , uh , you know , it 's just going to follow .
Yeah .
I do n't know . I , we have n't had any of it in our school system .
So , uh , you know --
Yeah .
We have n't either .
-- hopefully , we wo n't .
Yeah .
But I , I , I just kind of think it 's heading that way though , you know . It 's just , because it 's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff
and I just --
Right .
-- I just kind of think it 's going to eventually head that way .
Well and eventually it 's going to be not only the tea- ,
you know , the kids are --
Yeah .
-- going to be under scrutiny , it 's going to be the teachers .
Right .
And if they can test the teachers , that gives them the full right to test the kids .
Right .
And then they , you know , caught everybody .
Yeah .
Okay .
Uh , I have n't been in this situation yet .
You know , my , my parents are not quite at that age yet ,
so I have n't ,
They 're not quite elderly , huh .
No .
So I have n't , uh , really been in that situation although they are thinking about my grandmother
but , uh --
Uh-huh .
-- but that 's really about it .
How about you ?
Have you been in that situation yet ?
Uh , not for my parents .
But I , I was around , uh , two sets of grandparents , uh , quite a bit ,
we , we put one , I put one grandfather in a rest home --
Uh-huh .
-- and that killed him .
Did it really ?
Well , yeah ,
kind of .
Well , there was some other things involved
but it ,
before he was really active
and the ,
there was some ,
you know , he lost his drivers license
and I could n't get around and was n't able to do some things
and so we ended up just having to put him in a rest home .
Yeah .
And he just kind of became a vegetable and died .
Oh , no .
So --
That 's sad .
-- but that was a long time ago .
Yeah .
That was , uh , back in like seventy-three .
Oh , okay .
So , uh , I think the way they did things were a lot different back then .
I 'm sure they were .
Yeah .
And , uh , my grandmother , his , his wife --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , we also put her in a rest home .
She was in a rest home
and then she was back out because she did n't really need to be there and , uh , had a physical , had a good physical therapist at that place
and --
Ah .
-- they worked with her and got her walking and got her ta- , kind of taking care of herself
and so --
Yeah .
-- she was able to come back home
and --
Oh .
-- then she had to go back in a couple of times ,
but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up .
Um .
And they got her going again .
Yeah .
So I guess as far as looking ,
I said as what you 're looking for , I think you need to look for an active , uh , an interactive staff .
Uh-huh .
Somebody who is willing to work with , uh , you know , work with a patients and do --
Yeah .
-- do things with them and treat them , treat like they 're ,
And I 'm sure it 's , it 's expensive .
Yeah .
It , it is .
Yeah .
It is expensive .
Yeah .
My , my grandmother is not in a nursing home
but she 's in a --
Uh-huh .
-- oh they 're like , uh , they 're apartments for senior citizens --
Oh , uh-huh .
-- and she loves that because they arrange activities for them all day long --
Uh-huh .
-- and then they have , uh , where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go
and she , she , she really does love that
but she 's just concerned about i- , in the future , you know .
Uh-huh .
That , she , she knows it 's not going to be like that all the time .
And she 's just wondering well --
When she ca n't take care of herself .
-- what 's going to happen to me
and , and I ,
you know , it 's , I guess it 's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she does n't need that ,
but --
Uh-huh .
-- you know --
Now ,
-- she 's kind of asking questions about what , well what 's going to happen , this ca n't last forever
and so .
Uh-huh .
Does she have a ,
is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to --
Yeah .
-- or she can go down to the cafeteria ?
Yeah ,
she can
but I , I think it is also cafeteria style . Because I , I really , I , I , I doubt if she rarely cooks for herself .
Uh-huh .
So , uh --
In fact , I ,
-- because I , I remember her , in her letters , telling me she 'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat ,
so I 'm assuming it 's something like that too .
Uh-huh .
So .
Yeah ,
I , I really like that concept .
Uh-huh .
They 've , they have a few of those , well quite a few of those places like that here in Utah
and , you know , couples can ,
you know , husband and wife can , can live there too or , or whatever .
I ,
and , and then , and yet they have their , their friendships and relationships and the , you know , of getting together and eating together and all of that .
Yeah ,
yeah .
I , I think it really takes , uh , you know , looking more at the people than even really the facilities .
Uh-huh .
And she lives by herself too .
She seems to like it .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , my husband 's grandmother is ,
well , she lives , she lives in a house on her own
and she does n't really need the care or anything like that
but , she has her own home
and sh- , she 's doing really well .
I 'm really proud of her .
She 's doing really well ,
so we have n't had to do anything ,
but then again , she has a lot of support
so --
Yeah .
-- I mean , she 's got her mother in town too and things like that
so .
Yes .
Hopefully , we wo n't need to go that route .
Well , I , I think that that 's the thing that 's a little bit scary , you know , a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it 's , it 's almost like
that , you know , they say putting them out to pasture
and some , some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active .
Yeah
.
They , they wanted to do things .
They did n't , you know , they did n't want to go down and play bingo or , uh , you know , play with the oranges ,
Okay , I guess we 're on .
Yeah .
Central America , have you ever lived in Central America .
I was n't in Central America
but , uh , talking about Latin America , I kind of , I consider Latin America to include Central and South America
and I did live in , uh , San Polo Brazil for four years .
Do you , do you think that , that we should have given up the Panama Canal ?
Uh , realistically , I ,
yes ,
I do n't see the , the Panama Canal that has n't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it 's not , not really big enough to , uh , accommodate the , the shipping that it once did
and , uh , maybe it would be better that we let the Panamanians run it however , I think , we 're certainly justified in , uh , our actions dealing with , uh , Noriega in this ...
Well , there are those that , that , that think that , that , that the Panama Canal has some considerable strategic importance , particularly for the military .
Interestingly enough my father was , who was in World War One , and as , uh , as a civil engineer they , they , they offered him a commission as a captain if he would , uh , go in and , and , uh , help with the defenses of the Panama Canal .
He had worked for United Fruit Company there ,
Uh-huh .
and they , uh , they , in fact , they had ,
this was in the , the late twenties
and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over
and , uh , he turned them down .
It , it 's interesting that , that most people do n't realize how small the canal is .
Have you ever been there ?
No ,
I have n't .
It 's , it 's really ,
I , I have n't been there ,
I 've been to , been to Salvador
and , and , uh , in fact , we went back to visit some friends of , of my fathers , that we went in fifty-seven I guess .
And interestingly enough the canal is quite small and , and realistically could be sabotaged quite , quite easily .
The thing I find interesting , though , is that , uh , is the whole colonial approach
and , and , and do we , do we support the Sandinistas or , or do we support , uh ,
you know , when they thought , uh , they thought that Nicaragua , if you gave them a free election , they would vote for the ,
Will you , uh ,
did you ever studied the , the political makeup there , in , in , in Nicaragua .
I have a , a little bit ,
I ca n't say that I 'm , I would be an , an expert on , on the region ,
but , uh , certainly , uh , I , it , it gets , it ge- , there ,
your ,
you 've got this , this toss up betw- ,
or not , not so much a toss up but a , a dilemma when , when you want a country to have its , its , um , own , uh , dominion , or its free rein over its , its own people .
And then on the other hand , uh , the , uh , the government in power that under what seem , what seems to be popular support , uh , the Sandinistas had to a given extent popular , uh , support , um , starts making overtures to the Soviet Union . And , and into what we consider our sphere of influence
and now we 're , we 're in this dilemma over , uh , United States is , believes in democracy and , and self determination , where a- ,
but that
on the other hand we believe in self preservation and , uh , agree with the , or , not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about , uh , infl- , Soviet influence in , in what 's considered to be the United States sphere of the world which is not only , you , we used to see spheres
but now we 're in a situation where the United States is , looks like we 're it now .
Well the interesting part about it is that , if , realistically it was economic .
I do n't know if you read any of the history on where the Panama Canal
but there was an option to build it across Nicaragua ,
uh , and , uh , there were , uh , there 's a big , there 's a big lake ,
Uh-huh .
and , um , from a technical standpoint it would n't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in Nicaragua ,
but the , the United States , uh , had some ,
and I 've forgotten what the political influence was
but there were economic ties then .
The issue of , of
if , if it 's in the economic interest of the United States , uh , do we go in and , and prevail
and , and , uh , in other words do we make the world safe for democracy ,
Right .
but if there 's no economic benefit ,
and I think particularly if you 're , if you 're looking at the , at the , at the peasant , uh , whether he 's in Central America , regardless of where he is , is his life , is his life better off under communism or , or uh , or Democratic government .
You look at Salvador where the ,
Well he does n't care as long as he 's feeding his , uh , his family .
Yeah ,
and , and the question is , does the government make a difference .
If they 'll mostly leave him alone , uh ,
and I think that 's the difficulty they , that , that we have that , uh , it , it reality does n't make , uh , does n't make any difference if he has no income .
And apparently even some of our alleged , uh , Central American leaders that , uh , are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things ,
so it 's , uh ,
Yeah ,
well , yo- ,
in looking , bu- ,
if you look at the region in , in , uh ,
to their detriment they came from , uh , this , uh , hundreds of years of Spanish control
and the , and the Spaniards have , uh , horrible history of corrupt , uh , government , greedy , uh , rulers who have been , uh , manipulating , manipulating their public for their own , their own good .
I mean , if you go back to the kings and , and the , the conquistadors coming in and , and the hor , incredibly horrible things they did to the , uh , the native tribes ,
I mean they make , uh , they make the things that Custer did look like , uh , like trivial .
And , uh , you get ,
It is , it is interesting , that , that , you know we , we look at the exploitation
and , and , and then we accuse some other people of exploiting them
and , and Americans have , uh , have a pretty good reputation of exploiting ,
you know we basically the Panama Canal we went in and , and took it .
Oh , absolutely
and , you know we set up ...
and we stole it fair and square ,
I think is , uh ,
An ,
I mean , Ted , Teddy Roosevelt did n't have the reputation , speak softly and carry a big stick for , uh , for nothing
and , uh ,
Well what 's going to be interesting is to the see what the economic impact of , of , uh , of the , the region , uh , you know , at the moment , it , the tremendous drug traffic through there ,
but , uh ,
Right .
the idea of , of , uh ,
what 's the , what 's America 's role there
and it , it , uh ,
with , with other things going on , it , it seems to have lessened ,
but you 've still got , uh , Cuba that accepts , exerts some influence .
The only , the only thing I see about Cuba though , is , uh , after Fidel Castro dies , I do n't think they 'll be a communist power anymore .
I , I ca n't see communism in that country carrying on past him .
Well , when you take a , a situation where I think in particular in Salvador where there is a significant under class , excuse me ,
and that , uh ,
you know , having a , a lot of difficulty , uh , surviving , uh , the question is would they , you know , would they be better off under communism .
Yeah .
and I would n't , do n't know that I would advocate communism
but , uh , the question is can , uh , can you , can , uh , can a democracy , uh , afford the ,
it 's like the street people that are starting to show up all other the U S , is that ,
Right .
that 's essentially an underclass
and when you get enough of them , uh , you know communism would feed them all .
Ye- ,
well , I , I do n't know if maybe communism is the right , the right word for it
but what we would ,
there would have to be some kind of ,
there , there may be a point at which , at which , you 've , uh , you might want to consider some kind of socialistic , uh , organization or socialistic set up to , to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy .
Well that ,
yeah ,
if the guys got some incentive ,
if he 's got , uh ,
you know , if he , if he can raise enough , uh , coffee and bananas to , uh , where he 's got something to protect ,
other , you know ,
Right ,
right .
whether he can export or at least , uh , set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest .
But cocoa leaves sell real well right now , it seems ,
yeah .
Yeah ,
as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments .
Absolutely .
I do n't ,
it 's going to be hard to , um ,
we ,
if you , you ,
that , that 's where your absolutely right is we 've got to do something in that region to encourage , uh , or to make , to make him growing bananas profitable again , I mean .
Yes ,
but the , but the question is , you know , if somebody offered you , you know , a thousand dollars a day to , to grow something in your backyard , would you do it .
Right .
Well not that we could be bought ,
but , uh ,
I 've got to watch what I say here ,
I never know when the D I A may be , uh , listening on my phone .
Well of course , everything we 're saying is being recorded
and ...
Right ,
Of course ,
of course .
yeah ,
it 's tempting ,
it 's got to be , it 's got to be horribly tempting for those , those peasants .
Particularly , if you 're hungry .
Yeah ,
yeah ,
you ,
it 's not , it 's not just a matter of , uh , of having an extra car or having a better car , this is a matter for them of , of feeding themselves their wife and their family
and , and you ,
there 's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family
and there 's dishonor in not being able to do it
and ...
Uh , starving to death is not a , not a whole lot of fun either
and , that ,
uh , and , and , you know ,
No ,
no .
when somebody comes in an offers , I think that 's one of the real problems , particularly when , when the , uh , religious organizations , you know , the Catholic church has been accused of a lot of things .
Uh-huh .
In reality , I think , what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people and help them protect themselves ,
not that they ,
I 'm , I 'm not sure the Catholic church is , is , is particularly political
but , you know , if ...
Right .
Yes ,
um , I was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood , independence , or the status quo for Puerto Rico .
I was a resident , although very young of the sta- , of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when Alaska stopped being a territory and became a state .
Uh , so I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the question even though I do n't know very much about Puerto Rico .
Uh , I know that all the things that happened , relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive , uh ,
and I have a suspicion that , that I believe that a , the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or , or let it go , one or the other .
What is your situation ?
Well , I 'm , I guess I do n't have su- , such close experience with , with , um , an area becoming a state as you do .
Um , my concern is the economy because as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low sta- , uh , standard of living or at least , um , annual average income .
Um , part of this I suppose is justified in , in that the climate they do n't need , perhaps , the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need .
However , in that case , I guess I would favor status quo .
I have been to Puerto Rico and , and found it very , very interesting .
I did Peace Corps training there .
Oh that 's very interesting .
And so , um , you know , I saw it , also as a young student
and , and it was very foreign in a certain sense , although I had grown up in California
and so the Spanish was no problem .
Um , it was , it was , you know , very lovely
and , and the people seemed very friendly and , and nice .
I have ,
actually , I work with , uh , a girl from Puerto Rico
and , I guess I have never thought to ask her what she favors , um .
Your concern on the economy was one in terms of , if it became a state would that put even more pressures on , on Puerto Rico , or pressures on the U . S . in terms of aid
or ,
Well probably more on , in terms of the U . S . Um ,
you know , I 'm , I 'm not quite sure how the U . S . copes with this sort of thing .
I 've live abro- , abroad most of my life ,
so , I guess I , I 've been very cut off .
I lived actually in Lebanon ,
so , I was very cut off from the , the press as I , you know , and be , was becoming an adult .
So , I do n't know how the U . S . would cope with , uh , a new state that is so very , very poor .
Uh-huh .
Um , I guess , you know , we 'd have a lot of aid , if , if you consider the inner cities of like New York and , and how much aid it needs .
I suppose the whole country , or the whole , um , new state would require such aid .
I guess , um , we 're assuming that , that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than , than say Mississippi
or ,
I think so .
Okay ,
that 's something that , that I guess I have not much of an image of other than , than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a perjuritive sense but in a , in a carefree sense , I guess .
Although I 'm aware of the political problems and unrest , and , and also difficulties they have . Um , I do n't know whether state woul , statehood would improve their economy .
I do n't , I do n't know that the ve- , the act of being a state would have any impact on , on them .
Uh , I guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they do n't have now .
But of course if their economy is weak the- , there is not much of a base on which to tax .
I do n't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being , since they are n't a state , whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they are n't able to tax like a typical state would be .
How do you feel , though , about ,
well I guess it 's to their advantage to be a territory ,
but , um , I wonder how have , having been in a territory but only as a young student
and my parents were in the military at the time
so they did n't have ready negative feelings about being in , in Alaska at the time since they voted absentee .
I , I would imagine that it must be a little bit of a se- , feeling of second class citizenry , uh , to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote .
The District of Columbia people , for instance are quite frustrated , I think , at times in their not having a Senate representative .
Uh-huh .
Yeah ,
those , are good points , um , which obviously I had never thought about .
Uh , I do n't know , uh , I suppose they also , not being a state are probably freer to determine their own , um , ways of life than they would if , if ,
I 'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory .
Uh-huh .
Perhaps compulsory education .
Uh , I see what you mean ,
so that ,
Um , and taxes .
Yeah ,
taxes would undoubtedly be occurring .
Uh , there ,
I do n't know , I do n't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation .
Um , frequently the laws in a territory are , are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states ,
I ,
and I 'm thinking in terms of education .
But then again each state sets its own
and I do n't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico .
Um , it 's interesting because I have n't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to , uh , economy , uh , I had thought of it more in terms of political , uh , realization
and I guess I had automatically made the assumption that , gee , anyone would rather be a state of the U . S . than an independent country
so ,
Uh-huh .
Well , well actually I thin ,
one , one thing that I remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they 've recently voted that Spanish is the official language , which I always assumed it was anyway .
So , if they 've just taken such action , it would seem to indicate to me either they 're doing it because they 're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state , or maybe because they do n't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish , or Hispanic heritage .
Uh-huh ,
well that 's interesting too .
Well it sounds as though you are in favor of , uh , status quo .
I , I believe I would probably tend towards that .
And I think , uh , having listened to you relative to the economy thing , I think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these .
So I 'm ul- , I guess I 'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point ,
Well that 's interesting .
leaning towards the statehood .
Right .
What about if , if , um , they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood .
I think I would be troubled ,
I suspect , I believe that any of our states ,
and I ,
constitutionally I do n't think there are any prescriptions abo- , against that decision even if Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something .
Um , I do n't think there is any prohibitions .
I would be bothered by that .
I 'm , I 'm bothered by any tendency to resist what I think was one of America 's strengths
and that 's the , the , the melting pot .
Uh-huh .
Uh , I , I am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines ,
but I 'm troubled by too close a clinging to , to the past
and I 'm also realizing that , that a common language , I think , is the ultimate bond of a country .
Uh-huh .
And Canada , I guess , comes to my mind as they 're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever .
Uh , that I , I think that would be a negative step to make
and I think that that they would need to reassess that .
Um , I 'm troubled even in by bilingualism , uh , in so far that it intr- , it gets in the way of , of , of the melting pot aspect .
Uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
That 's interesting because although I tend to be bilingual , Spanish based on experience , um , I was in bilingual education in California
and I did n't have any problem with my students
but I noticed my , my brother , who was quite a bit younger , was learning Spanish in elementary school
and he ca n't speak a word .
Um .
And so , obviously it did n't work in California .
Yeah ,
but I 'm rather in favor of people being bilingual ,
Right .
and I 'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language .
Right .
But I 'm , I 'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level .
Oh , I see .
Um , I 'm , I 'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness I guess .
Uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
Well I think we have gone to time
and I appreciate your having called .
Okay ,
well thank you very much .
Good-bye .
Bye ,
bye .
Okay .
So what are your opinions on it ?
Well , let me preface it .
I 'm a ,
I was a staff officer in Vietnam , in sixty-nine and seventy --
Uh-huh .
-- and I 'm in active reserve now ,
so , uh , I 'm probably not going to have the MUMBLEx you think I would have .
Uh-huh .
Uh , it 's ,
I was an interesting , in that I think that he gave the American people some , uh , uh , a sense of the fact that , that , uh , wars are really run by politicians .
Uh-huh .
Uh , I ,
are you old enough to remember the war ?
N- ,
not much .
I 'm twenty-eight ,
so . No .
I really do n't remember anything about it .
I guess I was about ten when it ended .
Right ?
Yeah .
I was born in sixty-two ,
so when did it end ?
Well , December seventy-two , was when we bombed North Vietnam , and then they released the prisoners in early seventy-three ,
Yeah .
in that , in that time frame .
Because , I was ten ,
and I do n't remember a lot about anything at that time in my life very much in ,
I think ,
great detail .
the , the significant thing is , is today did , did you , uh , did you see Barbara Walters interview with Schwartzkopf ?
No .
I did n't ,
MUMBLEx .
but I , I did read the book .
I ha- ,
do ha- ,
I have six years of college ,
so I did read , and study about the Vietnam war though .
So I am pretty fa- ,
you know , I 'm more ,
Well , wha- , what 's --
familiar with it than ,
-- your perspective on it ?
Mine .
I think , uh , I think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation , and that , I think it was the right thing to do , to try and not to take away , to , you know , just leave their freedoms there and to , you know , get rid of some of the atrocities that were going to .
I do n't , I do n't know , I do n't really ,
I 'm tired of pacifist though ,
see on the other hand , I 'm a pac- ,
I 'm really struggling with it .
Am I a pacifist , physical pacifist , I 'm a Christian ,
and I believe that the real warfare is not with Saddam Hussein , or the North Vietnamese ,
but it 's in spiritual kingdoms , and that the real warfare is done , you know , in your prayer closet , on your knees .
So , in a way , in a sense I 'm a pacifist ,
but I 'm really not . You know what I 'm saying ?
Yes .
I do n't think just lay back and not do anything .
I think , lets go to war ,
but let 's go to war praying ,
and let 's go to war for that way
so ,
Well , well , the difficulty I have , is that , uh , are we our neighbor 's keepers .
Uh-huh .
And , this is what I find particularly difficult in that , uh , if we see injustice , and weather it 's in a , uh , you know , Chicago , or , uh ,
Uh-huh .
or , or Dallas , I , I think if we see it , you know , we see John Wiley Price hollering injustice , I think that 's wrong .
Now the question is , is was there injustice in Vietnam ,
or was ,
Uh-huh .
there injust in Iraq Kuwait ,
Uh-huh .
the difficult , I , point is , is to , where do we step in ,
and , uh ,
Yeah .
and , I think that we , that 's , that 's the part I have difficulty ,
and the , the other part is , that the , the , when , when your , when your , when your looking at Vietnam , and you say , well , is fifty-eight thousand lives worth it .
And ,
Uh-huh .
I do n't know that anything is worth fifty-eight thousand lives .
Still have a problem with , uh ,
you know , I have n't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this ,
but , and I know other Christians would disagree with me .
My husband and I , are kind of not even in agreement on this ,
but we do n't fight over it or anything ,
but , you know , how can ,
you know , the Bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you ,
and it 's like , be gentle unto all men , apt to teach , patient , kind ,
so it 's like how can you ,
I do n't know , for me ,
I do n't know , you know , I ca n't say that I agree with Vietnam , because how can you be gentle unto all men , and , and then shoot them .
Well , the ,
So ,
other issue is , is , is how do you allow , uh , how , how do you allow injustice . Just like the , the policeman in , in Los Angeles --
Uh-huh .
-- how could , how could ,
could you stand there and watch them beat that guy .
If your brother or your sister were being beaten ,
Uh-huh .
by the authorities do we step in ?
Well . In some cases we would ,
and I , I think that 's what makes it so difficult .
Yeah .
It is a difficult thing .
But then , vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord ,
and I will pay .
So , I think God is ultimately in charge of what goes on ,
and I know , like now MUMBLEx in China he did all these terrible things ,
and they were te , terrible ,
and he was going to be accountable for them ,
and , but if you look back , and you say wait a minute , while he was in power , he built roads , he put in all the temples , he , he unified the Chinese language .
It was impossible for missionaries to do , accomplish anything in China --
MUMBLEx .
-- because of all that ,
and so even in North and South Vietnam , I bet you 'd see the same thing , and that now he builds roads
so , then it
MUMBLEx and then he dropped dead , twenty-five years premature , he dropped dead ,
and so something good did come out of that , in that now , you see what I mean , if like now ,
Yeah .
But , but the other , the other difficulty is , is that it 's just , if , if you take the MUMBLEx to , to feed my sheep --
Uh-huh .
-- and the question is , who are my sheep ,
and the idea , do we go out and feed these people when they 're hungry .
Well . Bless your enemies , if your enemy is hungry , feed him ,
if he , if he needs your , asks for your shirt , give him your coat also .
So , if the ,
MUMBLEx .
the , the , the South Vietnamese , they asked us to help them .
Right ?
Is that right ?
Yes .
Uh , they did ,
but , I think the biggest difficulty is , is that when you 're at an MUMBLEx economy like South Vietnam , well , the , then reality , uh , the , the poor farmer , the poor rice farmer , was going to pay taxes --
Uh-huh .
-- and the question is , who was he going to pay it to ?
Yeah .
Uh , the communists are the , all alleged democrats . Uh ,
Uh-huh .
democratic formed government ,
and I , I think that 's , I think , I think , uh , that 's a little , was a difficult part , there ,
and , and , I ,
we did n't understand the culture .
We could n't , uh ,
we had , uh , we had a , a young lady that was fourteen that worked on our , in the unit I was commander of , that appeared to be eight or nine years old ,
and , and the people looked like children --
Uh-huh .
-- I mean , you could n't imagine that one would , would , would conceal a bomb and --
Yeah .
-- and do these kind of things .
I think socially , it really destroyed a lot of the people that , that went over and saw these people .
You just could n't believe that they would , that they would be mean , and , and , and , and drop bombs and kill people ,
and then --
Uh-huh .
-- we would turn around and , and nay palm them , you know ,
if --
Uh-huh .
-- and I think there was a lot of , a lot of tearing of emotions ,
and I think that if anything , that , when MUMBLEx he was saying the idea that we learned , we l- , we learned a lot from Vietnam --
Uh-huh .
-- now , it was , it was in general , bad ,
but , and , I do n't know , the problem is now ,
I 'm , I 'm concerned a little bit ,
that now that the gulf war is on , that we 're going ,
I think it was a good war ,
and it was okay --
Yeah .
-- to go beat up on people ,
and I think that , I think we need to , a little more justice at home .
I 'm not sure how we get that ,
wonder if there 's a connection there ,
but MUMBLEx ,
Yeah .
But then again , yeah ,
I 'd say it is wrong to MUMBLEx
and I 'm not saying president Bush made the wrong decision .
I think I 'm lacking in my ,
I do n't think I can come to a complete conclusion on how I feel about the Vietnam war , because I 'm going to interpret that , through the Bible ,
and I 've kind of always ,
I 've been a Christian five years ,
and I 've kind of avoided that , that , those , the war things , and how God approaches that because I think it 's just now coming up to where I really feel like I need to , come , you know , need to decide ,
Well , the difficulty is --
what I feel .
-- is if you look in the old test meat , and in the numbers of places that , uh , the Lord went out and just simply struck down ,
and that was part of the problem , when they went into the promise land ,
Yeah .
that they , that they , uh , they did n't destroy everybody ,
Right .
They --
MUMBLEx .
-- left a woman , and a child , and a ,
And ,
MUMBLEx the sheep .
Yeah .
and that , that ,
you know , and you ,
I think that 's one of those things when we get to heaven we 're going to ask God .
I know .
Why did you do it that way .
But then again , though Jesus the grace pushes you beyond the law , you know what I 'm saying ,
like , so he did n't just say , do n't kill your , do n't kill your enemies ,
but , not only do n't kill them , bless them .
You know , and so , therefore when we have an enemy come against us , I really feel like , that , I really feel like , I know I do feel this strongly , that when , if we had someone come and attack us , the best way to handle it would be to bless them , and humbly go to their other king , or the other ruler , and say , what have we done to offend you .
What can we do to rectify this situation ,
and that God would move in that sovereignly ,
MUMBLEx .
and he would get the glory , though , no king , no ,
Bush would n't , because it would n't make any sense , you know what are I 'm saying ?
Yeah .
It would look absolutely , ridiculously stupid ,
but it would work out , because , if you follow the scriptural principals , it 's going to work out , because those are , that 's the best way to do it , you know ,
but the thing is , is that then God gets the glory , not a president , not a king ,
and I think that 's a problem for a lot of politicians , is they want the glory .
Well , and , I , I ,
and even if the , even at the local level , when somebody 's assaulted --
Uh-huh .
-- what do you do , turn the other cheek ?
N- ,
well , I believe , personally ,
I ho- ,
I I MUMBLEx woman always says , my husband always goes three that , I guess .
Yeah ,
if the one , if somebody broke in my house , I would pray that I would have this faith , ta- , to , to take authority over that ,
and I know people that have done that .
I mean , I know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes , and just say I bind you in Jesus name ,
your ,
n ,
I just ,
and rebuke any enemy , because I believe it 's a spiritual war that 's going on ,
and it 's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home ,
MUMBLEx that 's not normal ,
there 's something going on there , and that I would have discernment by the holy spirit to deal with pride over that .
Do you see what I mean ?
Yeah .
And then the same in Vietnam , you would , you would n't handle Vietnam the same way , you would handle , uh , Saddam Houssein .
But , I was , I have a problem with all the killing ,
but I 'm not a new ager , I do n't believe
MUMBLEx I am not for one world government .
I 'm not for all these new age things .
I , I , you know , I do n't have a problem with , uh , national identity ,
and , I 'm an American ,
and having different nations , and all of this .
But , I 'm concerned about the killing that went on there , because I just feel like God has a better way to handle it , than that ,
and ...
Okay ,
um , so , um , do you have any favorite teams ?
Well , I kind of like them all .
I played for about eighteen years , all the way through college , and then , uh , kind of hung them up after college ,
but , .
Oh , I was going to say , you played pro ball ,
right ?
No ,
not quite .
Not quite , huh .
Made it ,
yeah ,
made it all the way through four years of college playing ball ,
but ,
Oh .
Anyway . Uh , being in Rochester , you probably like the Mets .
Yes ,
I 'm actually a Met ,
I 'm , I 'm one of these people who 's actually a die hard Mets fan ,
and an avid Yankee hater .
Oh , boy , it , I think it 's like one or the other , is n't it . I mean ,
Yeah ,
it 's , it 's ,
I , I , I find it very strange .
Um , more people ,
you know , real Met fans do n't like the Yankees
and real Yankee fans do n't like the Mets for some reason .
Yeah .
I never fou- , I never quite found a New York fan .
I always found a fan , you know , of either one or the other ,
and so , that of course means that when it comes to the American League my favorite team is the Red Sox --
Oh , okay ,
-- by default , because I went to college also in Boston .
I see ,
yeah ,
I like the , uh ,
huh , I guess if I had to pick a favorite team , any more , as well as ,
I kind of grew up rooting for Philadelphia .
Oh .
I 'm from New Jersey originally .
Yeah ,
so that , so that 's sort of close enough .
Yeah ,
well , we were thirty miles south of them ,
so .
Oh , so you were pretty close .
Yeah ,
right down the river ,
but , uh , so what are the Mets going to do this year without Strawberry ?
Well , I do n't know . Um , there 's , there 's a part of me that says that , you know , um , I 'm sort of glad Strawberry went away .
You know , when , when he sort of went away , I started thinking , yeah , well , he was performing fairly well ,
but he really was n't worth the baggage , you know .
Yeah .
Um , I think they 're okay ,
I think they 're ,
you know , I think they have enough people who are , who are , who are still in their prime , you know .
Uh-huh .
Um , I mean , certainly if you look at them compared to , let 's say , you know , um , eight years ago or something , they 're --
Yeah .
-- they 're , they 're , they 're , you know , they 're sort of in , in good standing , whereas , you know , um , I think , I certainly do n't think they 're the eighty-six team any more .
Well , I was going to talk to you about that eighty-six team .
Yeah ,
I ,
That was , that was the year they beat Houston in extra innings ,
right .
Right ,
they MUMBLEx beat Houston in extra innings ,
and then they actually won the series bye-bye sort of a sneaky route , um , against Boston --
Yeah .
-- when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner MUMBLEx .
I felt real bad about that ,
but hey , what can you do .
Hey , the guy 's making millions ,
he ought to be able to perform ,
right .
That 's right ,
well , actually , he , he , he was supposedly , um ,
there was , there was something wrong with him at the time ,
and I ,
Well , his knees were bothering him ,
yeah .
Right ,
and I , and I understand that ,
and I say , Hey if the guy ca n't play , you do n't blame that ,
uh , hit it to him ,
you blame the team , you know , for putting him in ,
Yeah ,
for having him out there .
That 's right ,
so .
Sure .
So , I , I , I was , uh , I was also , I was in school at Boston at the time .
Oh , boy .
So , I ,
it was actually wonderful because where I was they were half Met fans and , um , half Sox fans .
Yeah ,
I think we were all pretty much , uh , Astros fans , in the National League Championship Series --
Oh .
-- but there 's like two fellows from , uh , Brooklyn ,
and they , they were , you know , they were pretty much without having to say , they were pretty much Mets fans .
Yeah ,
yeah ,
well I guess they were , uh , I guess they must have been scared after the , uh ,
No ,
not really ,
they were pretty much thugs ,
they were n't scared very much , you know .
Well , that 's good ,
well , they 're Brooklyn boys , I guess .
Yeah
.
You do n't expect them to be , uh , much of anything but thugs .
I know . I was born there . Um .
Really .
Yeah ,
I , I was , I was also born in Brooklyn ,
so I can call myself a Brooklyn thug , although I 'm really not .
Okay ,
okay .
Well , I 'm not to say that all folks from Brooklyn are thugs ,
but
these two were definitely thugs ,
and they were from Brooklyn .
So I 'm kind of hoping ,
I , I , I guess , uh , any more
I pretty much pull for the Rangers though .
They 're , uh , they 're , they 're they , they have , I think they have the best facilities in the major leagues .
Yeah .
I love going to watch a game in Arlington stadium .
It 's great .
Well , that , that 's
actually , I think I make something , because I think ,
and , and , and in as much as sort of fan support helps .
Yeah .
You know , it 's good to have , um ,
The only problem is it 's not large enough .
It only holds about ,
I think they , when Ryan struck out his five thousandth player , they squeezed about forty thousand people in there .
Yes ,
it is kind of small .
Yeah ,
so they 're , they , they have plans ,
I mean , the owner tried to move them to Florida --
Right .
-- but , uh , they ended up sticking around in Arlington ,
and they 're going to build a new stadium in Arlington , as a matter of fact , not even in Dallas ,
Oh , that 's great .
So ,
So that 's , that 's something that we 're looking forward to .
Yeah ,
that 'll be nice ,
I mean , that , that , I think , tends to keep ,
I think stadiums MUMBLEx work tend to keep people happy .
Oh , case in point , Toronto .
Yeah ,
exactly .
Yeah ,
have you seen a game up there ?
Uh , I have n't been to any Toronto games yet .
But , um ,
Oh , boy , I saw it , I was up there on business , uh , last June and watched a game in the sky dome .
It was just phenomenal .
That 's , that 's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums , I think .
Of stadiums , yeah ,
well , I , I mean to get up there .
I mean , the , the best I 've been up here so far , you know , up , in up state New York --
Uh-huh .
-- is , uh , is , um , Rochester Red Wings game .
Now is Rochester ,
where , where is Cornell University .
Oh , Cornell is in Ithaca .
Ithaca .
Uh , yeah ,
so Cornell is about , um , somewhere , uh , about two and a half hours south of , south and east of us .
Okay .
So if you know where Lake Ontario is sort of .
Yeah ,
well Rochester is like right on the shores , is n't it ?
Yeah ,
we 're about ten miles south of Lake Ontario .
Yeah ,
okay .
Actually whoever built the city was an idiot , in my opinion ,
because they built it , they built it far enough from the city that it actually could n't be a port city .
Oh ,
Um , but they ,
Well , they say that from that space needle up in Toronto you can see the lights of Rochester on a clear night .
Oh , really , I ne- , I had n't actually known that .
Yeah .
Well , um , but we have our own , um , our own triple A team here --
Yeah .
-- the Redwings , which are --
Yeah ,
okay .
-- they 're a farm team for the Orioles .
Yeah .
So everybody hopes that , uh , they go all the way around here .
There 's the ,
they 're the big team in Rochester .
Those games are fun to watch .
You , you , you watch those games ?
Oh , yeah ,
I
actually , we , we , we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they 're fun .
Yeah .
Lots of really big ,
you know , lots of local fans , you know , small stadium , you know , um ,
and they 'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes , you know --
Uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
-- um , especially ,
you know , I 'll make a day game or something .
Yeah .
But they really seem to , uh ,
people really get into it .
I mean , I ca n't , I , I , again , I ca n't make any predictions about them ,
but I suspect they 'll go , uh , they 'll go fly .
Yeah ,
we used to like watching ,
my , my folks lived down in Beaumont ,
and , uh , on the campus of Lamar University they used to house the Beaumont Golden Gators who were a double A team for the Padres , I think ,
but , uh , they , they were fun games to watch .
Yeah .
Those are , those are , uh , I think those are more fun than major league games sometimes .
Someti- ,
well , there 's definitely a lot more hitting .
Yes ,
it 's true .
One of the advantages of not having pitchers who are --
Yeah .
-- uh , uh , you know , I guess , I guess when you start pitching real well , well , move them up . Bam MUMBLEx .
Yeah .
Yeah ,
but um .
So as far as the major league teams , I do n't know , the Rangers have been ,
you know , every year they always knock on the door early , and then just go into their skid about , you know , the end of June .
But they , they 've got so much young , raw talent ,
it 's just amazing ,
and then they just have n't been able to put anything together .
Well , the way I , the way I see it , is ,
I mean , um , you know , I can use a Met analogy here .
Uh-huh .
If you 'll think back a few years to when the Mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but were n't very sort of , well trained --
Yeah .
-- you know , back to , you know , maybe eighty , eighty-four or eighty-three --
Uh-huh .
-- or eighty-five , you know , when they were first , when they were n't quite the eighty-six team that , that , that they were .
Right .
I , I ,
that probably gives the readers a good shot for you this year or next year , I think , if , I think , the young talent really just has to build itself up .
Yeah ,
I mean , they 've been , they 've been young for a while ,
and they 're almo- , almost starting to age a little bit here ,
I just , um .
Yeah ,
yeah ,
they , they really hurting pitching wise .
I mean , they 've got Ryan ,
but , you know , who knows what he 'll be able to do .
He 's been ,
last year he started having some nagging injuries ,
and --
Right ,
but .
-- but , it 'll , it 'll be interesting to watch .
I hope to get up there .
We , we usually try to get to opening day game .
There 's several guys from our church try to go up there .
Oh , that must be nice .
Yeah ,
well , I , I guess we 're probably , oh , maybe a hundred fifty miles south of Dallas .
Well , that is n't too bad . Just a couple of hours .
No ,
not too bad ,
but it takes about two hours , two and a half hours to get there .
Yeah ,
well it takes me a good seven hours to get to Shay Stadium .
So , I do n't know .
That 's probably because of the roads .
You just do n't have ,
we , we 've just got a freeway .
We just get right on the freeway and just go north .
Yeah ,
well , actually , we can , we can , I can take a highway the whole way down ,
but it 's still , it 's some --
Well , it 's so crowded up there .
-- it 's , it 's almost four hundred hou- ,
I mean , I mean , it 's almost four hundred ,
you know , barring traffic , it 's four hundred hours ,
I mean , four hundred mil- ,
four hundred hours ,
right ,
four hundred miles --
Golly .
-- barring traffic ,
so , it 's , um , it 's , it 's , you know , it 's a heck of a drive .
We are substantially north of New York enough that , uh --
Yeah .
-- we do n't get to go play --
Um .
-- too often .
Well , yeah ,
you 're , you 're like a boat ride from ,
how far is it across the lake to Canada ?
Toronto .
Toronto ?
Oh Toronto 's only about two hours ,
yeah .
Yeah .
Toronto , I mean , I want to go see .
Do , do you drive there ,
or do you take the ferry , or what ?
Um , I can ,
I 've actually I 've driven ,
but I 've heard about the ferry as well .
Yeah .
Have n't taken it yet , though .
Have you taken it ?
Yeah ,
it 's a , it 's a beautiful city .
Yeah ,
um , I , I really love ,
I think that 's one of the most , uh , enjoyable things about being up here .
I 'm only up here for school .
Uh-huh .
So , and then , I mean , you go back to New York after school ?
Uh , no ,
probably south , maybe Texas .
Oh , really .
Some place south , and warm ,
I do n't ,
I 'm not a big , uh , I 'm not a big , uh , cold fan .
Well , what kind of weather are you having right now ?
Uh , right now we 're actually having , uh ,
it 's getting nice .
I mean , it was in the high fifties today ,
but three and a half weeks ago , we had an ice storm .
Oh , boy ,
yeah ,
we 've been up in the , oh , seventies , eighties , even up in the nineties a couple of weeks ago .
Oh , that 's great .
You know , about that same time branches were falling off everywhere ,
and we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks .
Golly .
Because of the ice ?
Because it , did n't make the nat- , national news too much , which I find really weird --
Um .
-- but , um , we were , I mean , um ,
you know , all schools were closed for almost , for over , for a week .
Golly .
There were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive .
Huh , illegal ,
Yeah ,
because they had so many power lines down --
Oh , yeah .
-- and so many , uh , things like that ,
so they were ...
Okay ,
we , we can , uh , be recorded while we talk about it .
Okay ,
well is your ,
does your city have mandatory , uh , recycling ?
No ,
we do n't have mandatory .
We , actually , we 're kind of slow up here ,
and we 've just started doing recycling probably last summer .
And it 's all voluntary .
So that 's interesting .
Cities have a mandatory recycling ?
Um , there , there 're some places that are strongly encouraging it ,
and that they city will pick it up .
That 's been one of the arguments here .
I 'm just sitting here looking . We 've got four bins of glass and plasticine stuff .
But we have to carry it , uh , some distance ,
and some places , um , you can sell your , uh , recyclables ,
and , for example , our church was collecting newspapers .
Yeah ,
when I was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing .
We got like a penny a pound for them .
Well , it turns out that so much ,
the problem in Texas is that , uh , they 've got so much paper now from people recycling that they 've got no way to , uh , reprocess it .
Oh , my ,
It requires an ex- , it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it ,
and so the value has gone down .
It turns out it was n't worth for the church to do .
Oh , I did n't realize ,
you would think ,
now up here , I , I suppose they send it all back to the mill
and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of , uh .
Actually there is one in northern Vermont .
So there 's probably a paper mill that 's sixty miles from here .
I did n't think that ,
you know , in the large city that if the next recycling , if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away --
Well ,
-- it 's a lot of money to transport .
Yeah ,
well see , that 's ,
in , in Dallas there no plan to build ,
I think there , there 's some in East Texas there 's some pulp mills ,
but , uh , you have to go to Houston ,
and , it 's interesting ,
and then there 's places that will buy metal
and they still buy aluminum can and likes that .
Do you have to buy metal ,
like copper is a very good one to collect .
Even aluminum ,
yeah ,
so .
Well , do you do , do you do recycling ?
Uh , we do the recycling ,
and our city will pick up our recyclables .
Oh .
They have these little blue bins .
Um , I do n't recycle personally .
I , I 'm saying I want to do it ,
but , I do n't get a lot of magazines ,
I do n't get a ,
I do n't buy the newspaper ,
but I do have a lot of , uh ,
my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of cart- , a lot of different papers and cardboards .
Well , do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans ?
