Okay .
So ,
I guess ,
What kind of experience do you , do you have , then with child care ?
I think , uh , I wonder if that worked .
Does it say something ?
I think it usually does .
You might try , uh ,
I do n't know ,
hold it down a little longer ,
and see if it , uh ,
Okay .
Well ,
Okay
I ,
Does it usually make a recording or s- ,
Well , I do n't remember .
It seemed like it did ,
but it might not .
I guess --
Okay .
-- I guess we can start . Uh ,
Okay .
No ,
I do n't , I do n't have any kids .
I , uh , my sister has a , she just had a baby ,
he 's about five months old
and she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and --
Uh-huh .
-- the different ,
do you have kids ?
I have three .
Oh , really ?
Uh-huh .
.
Yeah ,
I do .
Yes , uh ,
I do n't work , though ,
but I used to work and , when I had two children .
Uh-huh .
I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit ,
but I do n't envy anybody who 's in that situation to find day care .
Yeah .
But , does your sister live in a big community ?
Uh , yeah
she lives ,
it 's a , it 's a fairly large community .
She , uh , got real lucky , though .
He had a boss who , uh , moved into a larger office --
Uh-huh .
-- and she 's able to take her baby to work with her .
Oh , really ?
And it 's a small office that she works in --
Uh-huh .
-- and , uh , it 's a , it 's a legal firm , office ,
and it 's just one lawyer --
Um .
-- and so she 's the only one really that takes care of the office .
There 's no one else that works there .
Uh-huh .
And so they have an extra room and everything for the baby ,
so it works out pretty good for her .
Wow .
.
How lucky .
I , I know a lot of people around here sometimes have , like , mothers or grandmothers --
Yeah .
-- that take care of their kids
and , but , the community I 'm in is not a real large one ,
so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that , you know ,
you either know them or know somebody who knows them , to get to ,
Yeah ,
so it 's fairly safe .
Yeah ,
to get references and that ,
so , but , uh ,
I , I d- , do n't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center , but , simply because there 's so many kids and so many ,
Worried that they 're not going to get enough attention ?
Yeah ,
and , uh , you know , colds and things like that get --
Yeah .
-- spread real easy and things ,
but , and they 're expensive
and , course , there 's a lot of different types of day care available , too , you know , where they teach them academic things .
Yes .
Or they just watch them and let them play and things like that ,
but ,
take a long time to find the right place
.
Yeah ,
and you , and you do n't always even know if it 's , it 's going to be the right place or not .
Uh-huh .
Anything , I guess , could happen .
Uh-huh .
Because after , I guess after he , you know , gets to a certain age she 's going to have to take him to a day care .
Uh-huh ,
when he starts toddling around and stuff .
Yeah .
Yeah .
When , when he 's not , when she ca n't keep control of him
and he starts crawling
that 's ,
Uh-huh .
It would be hard ,
I think it would be kind of stressful .
It would be nice to have him around --
Uh-huh .
-- but , uh , seems like , you know ,
goll- ,
what if he cried at the wrong time
or the phone rang or ,
.
you know , at the wrong time .
Yeah .
But ,
I think she has problems with that , too .
Uh-huh .
Well , when you have kids , will you work ?
Do you --
I do n't know --
-- work now ?
-- that 's something I 've considered . Uh ,
Uh-huh .
I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time .
Uh-huh .
Is that what you do ?
Uh , yeah .
Actually , I teach my kids at home ,
so I 'm here all the time .
Oh , so they do n't go to school .
Is it like , uh ,
oh , what 's that called ,
it 's , uh , correspondence school ,
they do it --
Uh-huh .
-- at home .
Yeah ,
yeah .
That 's interesting .
So ,
Do you have to have any special training ?
Not ,
it depends on the state you live actually .
Some laws absolutely prohibit it .
Some states , uh , say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that .
Our state does n't yet , say that
and I 'm not a certified teacher .
I went to college ,
but I , you know , but my kids are only elementary grades , levels right now
and so ,
So they have n't been to public schools at all .
One of them was for a couple of years
and so , you know , my oldest , he was ,
and then my youngest two have never been .
Um .
So anyway ,
but we do n't ,
So , you 've never had ,
Well , uh , does the company you work for test for drugs ?
Actually , uh , they just recently started a policy of testing drugs , which was kind of interesting ,
because w , when I went to work for them , uh , they did n't do that ,
but , uh , since then they 've , they 've started a drug testing policy , not because of their own , uh , convictions , but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that .
Huh .
How about you ?
Uh , no ,
we 're not being tested for drugs at all , uh ,
our policies and procedures manual , uh , the furthest it goes about drugs is in the , kind of the miscellaneous section , or --
Uh-huh .
-- its reasons for immediate dismissal ,
it says , use of narcotics on company premises .
Um .
So that 's pretty general ,
but , uh , I work for an environmental management firm --
Okay .
-- and I 'm an engineer there ,
but I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites ,
but I do n't operate any machinery .
Yeah .
Now , people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that --
Uh-huh .
-- are under a , a medical monitoring program ,
because they 're at a higher risk of exposure
and blood screening is part of that
and I , I think that drugs ,
they do test for drugs in that capacity ,
but it 's not their exclusive ,
it 's just part , it 's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for .
Yeah .
But I think it 's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field .
What is the nature of your company 's business ?
Well , it 's actually , uh ,
we do oil well services .
So , a lot of our clients are oil companies , big oil companies ,
and they go out to ,
we have engineers who , uh , go out to the oil well , to the , to the client 's oil well , and , and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff ,
so the clients are very concerned that , you know , the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy , because they 're on their , their , you know , territory and everything ,
but --
Um .
-- the thing that 's interesting is that I w- , I 'm an engineer and , a software engineer
and I work in the software , uh , house ,
and everybody there , you know , are all software engineers .
They 've never , you know , they never go out to the , the oil rigs or anything ,
and yet , we 're getting , we 're subjected to this policy , you know , the same one that , uh , th- , all the engineers have to , to ,
well , a little different , actually ,
but , uh , you know , we have to go through the same thing ,
and it 's , but it 's , uh , it 's a little different , I guess than , than a lot of drug policies .
In our case , it 's like , when you hire on , they 'll test you ,
and then if you get injured on the job , if you like trip and fall or something , uh , they give you a drug test right away .
Oh , really ?
Other than that they do n't have random testing or anything like that ,
but , a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first .
Particularly , like , uh , we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol ,
and tha- , they did n't find any problem with that , you know ,
but ,
Right .
Uh ,
We , that 's been an , a , an issue , uh , in our company even though we do n't have the random or even regular drug screening .
In fact , they 'll have these little parties ,
and people will just get ,
I mean , I 've ,
my brother lives where I work ,
and I have many a time called him to come get me , you know .
And , uh , uh , but , y- , you know , they do n't think twice about serving beer by the keg .
Yeah .
You know ,
but , uh , I think drug testing ,
and I , I do n't know ,
I guess I k- , I think it 's got some relevance ,
but I think its relevance is pretty limited .
I mean , I think , you know ,
in your case , I do n't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing .
Yeah .
I think that 's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident .
Yeah ,
it 's really , it 's really bizarre .
Uh , particularly , like where we are , you know .
I , I ,
there was a story of a woman last year who , who actually did slip on the ice and , and like sprained her ankle
and she , she was a personnel secretary
and she had to get tested
and , I do n't know
I 'm ambivalent about the whole thing .
I , you know , I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand , it 's like if , you know ,
they 're , they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense
and , you know , it 's like you 're , I mean , employments are contractual by nature anyway --
Uh-huh .
-- but , uh , I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job that , where I had to , uh , uh , do a drug test
and , and it 's , it was kind of a long story ,
but it was , it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through ,
and it amounted to , uh , going in , uh , before any of these interviews ,
I 'm not even working for this company ,
I 'm going in for , like , interviews
and they flew me out to Chicago
and , and , uh , before I went into any of the interviews , uh , they took me to the doctor to give me a physical .
They said it was going to be a physical , you know ,
and , uh , actually bec- , beforehand they told me they were going to , uh , do drug screening ,
but I had forgotten about that ,
and so , basically , I 'd already peed off in that morning
and , and when I got in there , I did n't , I was n't , like , able to give a full sample ,
and so --
Oh .
-- they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes , drink a whole ton of water --
Right .
-- before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again ,
and the , and the , the procedure is utterly humiliating .
You go in there with the doctor ,
he makes you take off all your clothes
and then he examines you .
Uh , the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a , uh , long term financial plan and monthly budget .
The only thing I do now is , uh , put the data into Quicken .
I do n't know if you are familiar with that .
Yeah ,
I have some friends of mine who use Quicken
and , uh , I 've considered using it once myself ,
but I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date .
Uh-huh .
So I , I kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken , at least for now .
Um . I 've found it 's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then , well , uh , uh , not bother to total it --
Uh-huh .
-- and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic .
So it really helps with that .
Yeah ,
well , it 's similar problems
but , uh , we just have the one check book
and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible
and occasionally we will get behind like you say
but , uh , it does n't really seem to be too , too tight if we just remember to keep everything up , up to date and balanced .
Uh-huh .
Well , how to you handle that , the long range or medium range planning on finances ?
Well , actually we have n't had to . Uh , until just recently .
I guess we 've got a , a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way
so --
Uh-huh .
-- we needed to start doing more of that just for , uh , you know , saving for college and things like that .
We tried a way , try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that .
Yeah .
Well that 's pretty good if you can do that .
I know .
I have a daughter who 's ten
and we have n't really put much away for her college up to this point
but , uh , we 're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away --
Uh-huh .
-- for college ,
so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction --
Um .
-- in the fall
and then the money that I will be making this summer we 'll be putting away for the college fund .
Um . Sounds good .
Yeah ,
I guess we 're , we 're just at the point , uh ,
my wife worked until we had a family
and then , you know , now we 're just going on the one income
so it 's --
Uh-huh .
-- a lot more interesting trying to , uh ,
find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to , uh , do it .
You know , kind of enforce the savings .
Uh-huh .
But , uh , it will be interesting to see MUMBLEx .
Well our situation is just a little bit , kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently , uh , took on a full time job , well almost full time .
Um .
So , it 's only recently that we 've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for , uh , long range goals like college and sickness and --
Um .
-- travel and that kind of thing .
That sounds good .
But , uh , uh , I was just curious , what , uh , part of the country .
Oh , Stockton .
Oh , okay .
How about you ?
Uh , Cincinnati , actually .
I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with , uh , the western accents or something like that .
I do n't know how many people are , uh , getting involved in this
but --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , well that 's interesting .
I 'm , uh , uh , actually , uh , I was kind of interested if you found out about the study by , uh , reading TELECOM DIGEST
or was there another ?
Uh , a colleague of mine at , uh , work got some information over , uh , the computer network called INTERNET .
Oh , okay .
Yeah ,
that is how I got it as well
but , uh ,
And he just forwarded that on to me
and , uh , it sounded like it would be an interesting project --
Uh-huh .
-- to participate in
so I --
Yeah ,
it will be interesting to see what ,
-- sent back MUMBLEx mail .
It would be interesting to see how the data base ,
MUMBLEx so , well , I guess we 're talking about the experiment .
Uh-huh .
Uh , probably need to try to get back on the topic
but , uh , it 's hard to talk about finances without without getting to , uh , dollar figures I guess --
Uh-huh .
-- you know ,
we could talk about some of the long range goals
and ,
Well what other long range goals do you have besides college ?
Uh , well I think , either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that .
It seems like every year my employer just gives back , you know , a little bit your tuition reimbursement .
Uh-huh .
I mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent
and now it 's , uh , now it 's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class
and , uh , it 's a real shame from what we had before , uh , because we 're ,
Right ,
uh , actually I lived over in Europe for a couple of years ,
I lived in Germany
and in Germany they do n't have the jury system .
What they do is they have , uh , three judges , basically .
And you get up there
and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence
and your defense attorney presents their evidence
and those three guys take the evidence , go off , figure it out and then come back and say whether you 're guilty or not .
Ou- , ou- , our judicial system is in such total chaos .
.
I think what they need to do is , they need to somehow take the money out of it .
I mean , when you have a man that 's signed a , a , a statement saying he 's guilty ,
we have a , a family called All day family .
They were all murdered .
Uh-huh .
All the people signed confessions ,
they went to a trial by jury .
They been trying these people now for twenty-two years , ever since I was a child .
Wow .
And what they 've done is they 've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they 've done ,
has nothing to do with justice whatsoever .
Well , you know , it 's , it 's one of those things ,
I mean , uh , uh , I would have to look at it .
I- , if they did it with the , uh , just the judges , the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight
because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day , they know all the procedures ,
they know what 's good and what is n't ,
they 'd be able to say , I 'm sorry ,
you ca n't use this as , uh , evidence , you know , because it was either illegally obtained or whatever
and , you know , you would n't have this , uh , uh , theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the , to the jury
and then the judge says , oh , no ,
d , disregard that .
Come on ,
any jury 's not going to disregard the evidence , you know .
Uh , that 's true .
I , I , I think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself .
That may very well be .
I , I hold it in the utmost contempt .
Uh ,
The , uh , d- , my favorite is the police department ,
they 're not aimed at the criminal .
The judicial system is aimed at the citizens
because you and I , we have work schedules ,
we can be called at work ,
we have Social Security numbers ,
they can trace us down ,
we have telephones ,
then we have checkbooks .
Criminals have none of these things .
They 're real difficult to catch ,
and if they do catch them , they do n't get any monetary gain out of it , whereas us , we write a check .
Yeah .
So where do you think they target their efforts ?
That 's true .
You d- ,
They target their efforts toward the citizens --
Well ,
-- not the criminals .
How would you go about changing it ?
You know , that 's a ,
I 've nailed the problem down
but I ,
.
.
Leave the details up to somebody else , huh .
Yeah ,
I 'm going to have to leave those details like , what would you do about ,
I think , to begin with , you would h , you would have ,
like , here in Atlanta area , our crime rate is just astronomical ,
yet , you go out on the streets
and they 're giving speeding tickets .
Yeah .
I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from ,
Well , you know , uh , talking about the lawyers , you know what might very well do , uh , cause a , uh , a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that , is to set the fees for cases .
It 's kind of like do it , do it in the similar vein similar , like , uh , V C R or television repair .
If you take your T V in , a lot of these T V repair places will say , well , I 'll repair your T V for a hundred dollars ,
and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that 's really tremendously wrong with it , then he eats it .
He , he repairs it , gives it back to you , and takes your hundred dollars .
Now , if he comes in and says , you know , I 'll repair your , your V C R , or somebody else 's V C R , for a hundred dollars , gets in there ,
maybe it 's a blown fuse ,
takes him two minutes ,
he fixes it ,
he still charges you that hundred dollars .
So , maybe if we did that with the lawyers , so that , you know , whether it 's a murder case or a , you know , a civil , uh , somebody suing somebody else , you get X dollars for that case
and that 's it .
Now ,
None of this ,
I firmly believe in that
because when you get the most heinous of crimes , have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney ?
Oh , yeah .
And here 's this bum that did n't have a job --
Yeah .
-- and he 's got a attorney that you and I could never afford .
That 's true .
Who 's --
Yeah .
-- paying for that ?
Um , y- , well , you , you know , you 're talking to part of them that 's paying for that .
Yeah ,
and you 're talking to the other half that 's paying for it
.
That 's right .
You know that 's , it , it 's , it 's amazing
and , and when you stop and look at it , I mean , the judges , th- , they 're all former lawyers .
Yeah ,
well , that 's another problem .
I think to really correct the judicial system , you have to get the lawyers out of it .
.
I mean , they 're , they 're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever ,
and with that type person running it , I mean , you , you could expect that you ,
Do you know anyone that , uh , is , is in a nursing home or has ever been in one ?
No .
But I , my grandparents were looking into it before
so I know what they 've said .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , I 'm trying to think .
My , uh , uh , wife 's grandmother had Alzheimer 's
and they were going to put her into a , a nursing home
and , uh , they , when they put her in , she had all kinds of trouble
and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a , a , you know , a , a nuisance . Or worse than a nuisance ,
I mean --
Oh they thought it was too much of a bother .
-- she sort of went , you know , bananas
and they could n't , could n't deal with her .
So , I guess you need to , uh , know whether it 's a , you know , a no deposit , no return kind of thing whether ,
Right .
If they 're equipped too , to handle the kind of patients you 're going to have --
Yeah .
-- you know , put in there too .
Because I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still .
Right .
They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her
but they wanted to be independent as well .
Right .
Have their own room .
My grandmother actually was in a , a nursing home that , uh ,
there was a retirement hotel and then a , uh ,
there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it
so for , uh , the first few years she had her own apartment and , you know , made her own meals sometimes . But could , could also go and eat someplace else .
Uh-huh .
And then , uh , as she became less able to take care of herself , then she moved into this other part that was able to , uh , provide full-time care
and , uh , she did n't have to do anything anymore .
But my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly .
And that 's som- ,
I do n't know whether that 's because they , you know , sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the , the reason is .
But I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something .
Well a lot of it 's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help .
Yeah .
They need health care
so they 're already ill before they go .
Right .
That 's probably a large factor .
Yeah .
If , if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you , then you stay where you are .
Then you only go there as a last resort .
Uh-huh .
Or people send you there as a last resort .
Right ,
right .
That 's what my grandparents ,
it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened , there was somebody there for them .
Uh-huh .
So that was their thinking .
Somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency .
Right .
And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make .
Right .
So they would n't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time .
I guess that 's a problem too for people . Wait lists and all .
Yeah ,
I guess .
That , uh ,
you ca n't always get in when you want too
and of course , you ca n't just sit around and wait .
Right .
When you need it , you need it --
Yeah .
-- I guess .
And the money is also another issue . How you 're going to pay for it .
Right .
At that stage of life you only have so much money left
and I guess it 's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings .
Yeah .
I mean it is kind of fair ,
but it 's also not fair because they have their own children to raise .
Sure .
So it 's another problem .
And you probably , if it were you , you probably would n't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price .
Right ,
right .
So , it , it 's just so complicated anymore , I think .
People outlive their savings .
And , with medicine being the way it is , you 're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down
and they 're not necessarily enjoying life anymore .
Yeah .
Well maybe that 's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it 's not worth continuing .
It 's just a shame that 's the way it has to be .
I think --
Yeah .
-- the retirement home idea 's a nice idea . To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay
and cause like if your spouse died , MUMBLEx all alone , it 'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you .
Right .
To have friends .
Yeah ,
I 've known quite a few people that have , uh , gone to retirement communities .
I do n't know if they have them back there
but here in California and in Ari- ,
Okay .
Uh , so , what do you think , uh , about putting the elderly in a nursing home ?
Well , I think that it , it varies on on the individual basis .
Huh .
Uh , sometimes it is , there is no alternative .
Uh-huh .
Uh , you do not have , uh , uh , family available or family that 's , uh ,
you may not even have family that is , uh , uh , in , you know , who are around .
That 's true .
Yeah .
So , sometimes it 's not an alternative .
Huh .
And I think , uh , but I think also , sometimes it can be , uh , a benefit if it 's for a short time .
Sometimes in a nursing home --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , especially if , if it 's after an acute illness .
To get over a ,
or to rehab after , uh , an illness .
That 's true .
I never thought of that .
Yeah .
Sometimes you know , sometimes the nursing homes are good for , uh , just short periods of time .
That 's true ,
until they get over that hump --
Uh-huh .
-- of whatever it is they 're dealing with .
Because too often the acute hospitals will , are sending them out much faster than what they 're --
Yes .
-- really able to .
They really are .
They do n't like to keep them --
So --
-- longer than a week .
-- so there is some good to it .
Yeah .
Uh , sometimes too , it 's used as a dumb job .
You know the fam- , --
What do you mean ?
-- well the families do not necessarily , uh , know what to do with them
and they do n't want to take the responsibility
so they will put them in a nursing home .
Yeah ,
that 's true .
So you see , uh ,
there 's both sides to it too .
What do you think ?
Yeah
and it depends on how , how sick the person is too . What you 're capable of , like if you have a family to take care of , you know , of your own .
Yeah .
Yeah ,
uh , I would personally like it
if my parents were to get ill , I would like to take care of them at home and if I had the money with some help .
That 's not always possible .
That 's true .
But , uh , to the best of my ability , I 'd like to do it until it gets impossible .
I think that 's also where you 're going to have a lot of people who are going to ,
it 's there 's not a choice , it 's --
Right .
-- because , it 's not economically feasible even to --
Uh-huh .
-- put them in a nursing home .
Yeah .
So that , that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the , uh , either Medicare or insurance to cover it .
That 's true .
Yeah .
So ,
But I think nursing homes can be good .
It just depends on what kind they are .
You know , you need to check them out ahead of time .
Yeah ,
and then there 's also some that are set up for specialties --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , I know some .
Unfortunately , some elderly have to go to or have , I guess it 's Alzheimer 's or where --
Uh-huh .
-- they wonder or , or , uh , confused or have some mental problem .
Yeah ,
that they 're ,
And you need a special nursing home for that .
You need one that has a unit that 's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around --
Yeah .
-- and you need people who are trained for that type --
Right .
-- of problem .
Who know what they 're doing with that .
Yeah
so , so there 's different types of nursing homes I think .
Yeah
well , my , uh , grandmother 's not really in a nursing home , but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it .
And she really liked the idea of , of moving there .
She 's not ill yet --
Uh-huh .
-- but , uh , she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years
and then she decided that , uh , she 's eighty five years old , that eventually , you know , she she does n't want her family taking care of her and being a burden .
She 's very independent .
So she 's in this nursing home .
It 's out in the country
and , uh , she really enjoys it right now because she does n't have to wash dishes or cook .
Gives her a little bit of her own independence --
Uh-huh .
-- but she still has , uh , a security there .
Right .
Some support .
And then there 's also , uh , sort of a wing for those people that do get sick
and , what I like about it and I think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now
and then , so if she ever does become ill , uh , it will be like family around her .
That 's right
and I --
Yeah .
-- I 've seen some of them like that too
and also they have a lot of , uh , activities going on for the ones --
Uh-huh .
-- who are more active .
Yeah .
Sh- ,
So it 's not sort of like , uh , uh --
Uh-huh .
-- a sick place .
No ,
she loves it .
She has a great social life
and she travels
and , uh , it 's in , in the very in the mountains
and it 's beautiful
and , uh , I , I hope that I have something like that when I get older .
Yeah
I , I think , I think the , uh --
Uh-huh .
-- I think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the , uh , elderly --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , person who 's going in and the family that 's going to be , uh , effec , effected by it --
Oh definitely it 's ,
-- and , uh , you know , sometimes it can , those choi- , those choices can be made in advance
and sometimes --
Right .
-- the choices because of the nature of the illness when they 're ,
So , uh , do you happen to be working for a large firm ?
Well , it 's about three hundred and fifty people .
I guess that 's not large compared to some ,
but it 's big enough .
Uh-huh .
And they have a , they do n't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything
and I wish they did .
Yeah .
You know , they have a four O one K ,
but I put all the money into it .
Uh-huh .
They do n't add anything .
What about you ?
Uh , I work for a fairly large company .
It 's got eight thousand people .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , we do have health insurance .
We do n't have four O k- , one K plan , stuff like that ,
but we do have , like , retirement .
They kind of match up to , you ,
if you put six percent , they match up to six percent ,
and then the rest is whatever you want to put in . If you put more than that or something like that .
Oh , that 's a pretty good deal .
It 's not bad .
Now , how long does it take for your contribution to vest ?
God , I do n't know .
It 's probably a long time .
I 'm sure it 's not till like twenty-five years , thirty years .
Yeah ,
the place I work at 's , health insurance is kind of expensive .
It 's like hundred bucks a , a month or something --
Yeah .
-- for a family .
Huh , well , I guess what we have is like a f- , what they call a flex benefits plan where you , you get like a certain amount of dollars
and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need .
Otherwise you can , uh , guess you can put , also put money , hold money back and then either use or lose it and that does n't get taxed or can just have that money , you know , put in your paycheck .
Yeah ,
we have one of those use it or lose it plans , too , where , uh , they 'll basically pay for , uh , you know , child care type , uh , expenses .
I can send in a , uh , can send in a request for payment
and they 'll , uh , and they 'll send me , you know a check for the amount they withheld .
That 's pretty good , you know .
It 's , uh , it saves a third off on taxes or something .
Yeah ,
well , it depends on which company you work for .
I know that , like , the , the , the one plan that everyone seems to be in , in my place is , uh , you know , you , uh , think you call it plan D .
Deductibles are really high ,
it 's like fifteen hundred dollars ,
but if you go for the other ones you 're paying too much money for them because it 's unlikely , if you 're f- , relatively , uh , healthy , then it 's really unlikely that you 'd use that much , amount of money , you know .
So , the- , it , you know , someone did start a cost benefit analysis ,
and ends up the best is to take a high deductible and , and take a loss , what , whatever it happens to be , if you happen to be a healthy individual .
Yeah ,
I guess ,
uh , on the other hand , you know , I , I had a similar , had a similar health plan
and , uh , one of my kids was in a car accident
and , uh --
Um .
-- I had , wound up having to pay for , you know , a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of , you know , no , no insurance policy happened to cover it , which is ,
Really ?
You mean , not even your , your , your car insurance ?
Well , it , it got all screwed up because I had a high deductible on the health insurance , no fault here ,
and , and I had a high deductible on the on the , uh , on the c- , car insurance
and then s- , you know , we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and blew it .
Oh , that 's too bad .
Oh , well .
Yeah ,
uh , well , I do n't know ,
I think other than health insurance , I think , uh , you know , an extra week of , uh , time off would be nice .
I only get two weeks .
Yeah ,
yeah
my place you get two weeks when you start
and then every , every year they give you an extra day until you 've got four weeks .
Oh , that 's nice .
We do n't get them till , till your seventh year of service till --
Aye .
-- you get an extra week .
That 's a long time .
Yeah ,
it 's , uh ,
Yeah ,
especially in the kind of engineering job I 'm in , you know , companies do n't stay afloat that long ,
and , and they ,
Uh , with the telecommunications type of company , supposedly you , used to be much more stable .
It 's a lot less stable than it used to be .
They used to have job security crap ,
but now they do n't .
So you work for Bell or something like that ?
Yeah ,
it 's the Bell Corps , which is , uh ,
Right .
Yeah .
Right .
So , I do n't know ,
it 's , it 's , uh , no longer .
So that 's what ,
I think it 's still based on the old model of ,
and , and now they do n't , uh ,
A lifelong job security
telephone --
Yeah .
-- pioneers of America ,
all that stuff , huh .
Yeah ,
but they , no , no longer .
.
I do n't think so .
Right .
Uh , hearing a lo- ,
there 's always , they 're always laying people off , which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security .
Is it , I mean , does it ,
they must have pretty good severance , though , huh ?
Oh , I do n't know ,
we do n't , we have n't been doing layoffs .
We 've been doing , uh , down sizing with , uh , getting rid of extra layers of management .
And , uh , I do n't know what they do for those people .
Mean the , the , the management they get rid of ?
Some of it ,
yeah .
Um .
There 's too many manage , too many chiefs and not enough Indians
but ,
Oh , they , they put ,
Well , have you ever served on a jury ?
No ,
I 've not .
I 've been called ,
but I had to beg off from the duty .
And you ?
Well , I was called
and then I was not chosen .
Um .
Well , I was , I was , uh , originally chosen primarily , I think , because I was a young fellow
and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict .
I do n't know why .
Something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago .
Oh , really ?
Yeah ,
it 's that the younger they are , they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason ,
and they kind of liked me .
I looked conser , and all that stuff
and they ,
I do n't know what they saw in me ,
but they saw it .
But , uh , back to the issue , is , uh ,
I do n't know ,
at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted , especially in cases in which there 's no smoking gun .
But , there , too , there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable , particularly , I think in civil cases .
In criminal cases , I 'd like to see the unani- , unanimity remain ,
but in civil cases , I think a majority rule by , by jury would be sufficient .
Well , uh , could you give me an example of a case where you think that ?
Well , in a criminal case , say one in which , you know , there is , like , say assault or some such . I think there ought to be a unanimous , uh , vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this .
And in civil law there , you know , is such a thing as like , let 's say , uh , misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that .
A majority rule , I think , would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases .
I do n't know if I 'm making any sense or not .
Well , I mean , I think ,
are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more , uh , tangible
or ,
Yeah ,
often there 's more incriminating evidence .
Like , for instance , say , uh ,
and also , too , I think I 'm , I 'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more , uh , serious in a criminal case .
Well , do you think that , that in a civil case , if there was majority rule , that it would be easy for someone to be set up ?
Um , well , I really ca n't say for certain , truth be known .
Uh , as it stands , there 's , there 's many ways and means by which a person can be set up , both , uh , in a civil , uh , civil and criminal case .
I mean , the , uh , documentary , the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that .
You know , I do n't know for , if you 're familiar with that or not .
No ,
I 'm not .
A , uh , fellow when he was much younger , uh , was tried and convicted and sentenced to death .
Fortunately , in his case , the death penalty was revoked
and , uh , so he served out his , his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system .
The case was reopened
and he was exonerated .
Well , I mean , I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served .
Yeah ,
many laws , but little justice .
Say ,
but , uh ,
and I also think , just like you were talking about before , why you were chosen to be on a jury that , uh , the , just , the process of picking jurors is not always objective .
Oh , certainly not ,
certainly not .
And , you know , they like to think that they 're getting someone who 's objective in all this ,
but they 're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers ' desires .
You know , the ,
because you get up
and , and they ask you a few questions ,
both sides do ,
and then you , you 're either challenged which is ,
you know , each attorney can use that as much as they like
or , I think it 's a limit now ,
they probably have a limit now ,
but , they pretty much go through that ,
and then you have to give a reason to the court why you ca n't serve .
For me , it was financial hardship ,
so . But , onto the thing , uh , I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing .
It was always my impression that the Justice himself , or herself , had the final say .
Okay ,
so I guess it starts recording now .
Okay .
Okay .
I do n't know , really know that much about the recycling in this area that we 're in .
We live in the Saginaw area .
Saginaw ?
Uh-huh .
And I 'm not real familiar with , uh , anything that ,
I ,
fact as far as I know , the school does n't have any kind of programs or anything out here . And , uh , or the grocery store or anything --
Really ?
-- in this area ,
yeah .
The rec- ,
we live in Plano
and they started off recycling by , uh , putting the ,
I think at each Wal-Mart , they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that , which now ,
I guess the , uh , city is , has bought the big green trash cans
and , uh , we , they have a recycling truck that comes around now
and you separate your glass and paper --
Uh-huh .
-- and , uh , aluminum
and you set it out
and they pick it up
and it , it works real neat .
They seem to be having a real good response .
Really ?
So ,
That is pretty good .
I 'm , we 're originally from another state
and I know in the state we were from that they did that t- , similar type thing .
The city brought ought , you know , set tr- , separate trash cans
and you separated your stuff
and you put it in there
and they took it , you know .
Did they , did they , like on bottles , did they give you a so many cents back for --
I do n't really know .
-- for cans
even or ,
I do n't really know ,
they , they started after we moved down here
and so --
Yeah .
-- I , I 'm not really familiar .
I just know that , uh , my in-laws up in , up in Oklahoma , that 's how they do , you know , they pick it up ,
but I do n't know if they get a , get anything back on it
or , do you get money for it ?
No ,
I just , I noticed it
Iowa and other cities like that , it 's a nickel per aluminum can .
Oh .
So you do n't see too many thrown out around the streets .
Really .
Or even bottles .
.
You know , all kinds of bottles they , they , they really charge people to , I guess when you purchase them and , and then when you turn them back in .
Right .
I n- , I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel .
Right .
And now , now most of them are throwaway .
Right .
.
So , maybe that 's one thing they can do .
I think now they 're a lot more expensive than that .
Uh , I bought some Cokes the other day in the br- , the little bottles --
Uh-huh .
-- you know ,
and I think the bottles were like , I know they were at least ten cents apiece .
I started to see , at home ,
I was like , God , how much were those bottles you know ?
-
Yes .
And , it was , they come in like , uh , eight and , and eight and ten packs , you know --
Right .
-- instead of six packs
and , uh , and they were like , it was like two dollars and something for the bottles .
You know , I was like God Almighty ,
it costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes .
That was my brother 's first job in a grocery store .
He was in the bottle area .
In the bot- , MUMBLEx .
It 's pretty dangerous out there , you know , when they fall over ,
but --
Right .
-- but it 's , uh , it 's quite ,
they say that the green glass now , that there 's a big glut --
Oh , really ?
-- of green --
Of green glass .
-- the green glass ,
yeah .
It 's amazing .
Well , out in this area , they really do n't have anything .
Now , I know that like Minyard 's --
Uh-huh .
-- and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores , they have like four different bins out front .
Right .
Uh , different colors for different things and , and things like that ,
but I , I do know some of these places were doing that
and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them .
Right .
.
Yeah
it 's ,
I notice the plastic have sort of faded away , the milk jugs .
Yeah .
It , it 's ,
people just ,
they , they really do n't ,
uh , there 's too much labor involved I guess to separate the stuff .
Yeah ,
more than it 's worth .
It 's ,
I do n't know ,
it , it can be ,
it 's not as easy ,
.
selecting , you know , clean junk as they say .
Right .
Well , who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away .
That 's right ,
that 's right .
It 's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher .
Right ,
uh , yeah .
We all do it .
.
Well , it was nice talking to you .
It was nice talking to you .
I have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything .
Oh , I think , I think two or three minutes is --
I- ,
-- fine .
Is that it ?
Yeah .
Okay ,
well , it was nice talking to you
and I , I guess I 'll do this for , I was doing this for , actually , I was going to do it for my son so that he could , uh , he , he 's in high school , so that he could make some money .
Right .
Uh , but then it has my name on it ,
so I 'm like , okay ,
I 'll sit down here and call it .
Well , we 're doing it for a church choir
so ,
Oh , are you ?
Yeah .
Oh , that 's interesting .
So ,
That 's nice .
Well ,
Well , thank you .
Thank you .
Bye .
Bye-bye .
So . Have you heard about Saturns ?
I 've heard some about Saturns .
I do n't know a lot about them .
I have n't been over , uh , to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight 's paper that said that their , uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the , I guess , the Japanese cars .

Ooh , that 's great .
Actually that 's kind of the type of car that I , I 'm thinking about we might get .
Saturns , you ca n't go to a dealer unless you go to a , a Saturn dealer .
Uh-huh .
This , this offshoot of G M .
Yeah .
And , uh , supposedly , they 've got great customer satisfaction from what things I 've heard .
Um . Yeah ,
I 've heard a lot of people like them .
Uh , yet I do n't know wh- , whether I would buy Saturn or not at this point .
I 'm kind of ,
my card and , uh , desires tend to be pretty picky
and so , uh .
Well , like what ?
Well , let 's see .
I li , I like cars that are designed with , with human beings in mind ,
.
and that 's not just the driver and the passenger
but that 's the person who 's working on it ,
cause I do al- , almost all my own maintenance and , uh --
Uh-huh .
-- those types of things .
And I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in , uh , finding a ca- , car anymore that 's , that 's fairly easy for me to work on , it 's just not very eas , it 's not very ,
almost unlikely at this point .
Yeah .
And , uh , yo- ,
Yeah .
I 've got a sixty-five Mustang
and --
Ooh .
-- I , and I do the work on , most of the work on that myself .
Uh-huh .
And when I look at modern cars and stuff like that , I just say I will never do that with the modern cars .
It 's not worth my time .
You ca n't get in there .
You ca n't do anything .
Yeah .
And it 's so complicated too .
I look at it
and I say , boy , you know ,
I , I 'd have to almost go take a class or something like that .
Well I 've got an eighty-three Saab .
Uh-huh .
And I find that for a normal , you know , everyday things . It 's really very easy to work on
and so , uh , you know , I 'm kind of spoiled .
I used to have a MUMBLEx Chevy .
Uh-huh .
With a three fifty in it .
Yeah .
And , uh , I really liked working on it . Uh , cause it was pretty easy too .
It was about a nineteen seventy .
So I 'm kind of , uh , biased in that
and , you know , I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore .
Yeah .
And that 's kind of , that 's , that 's probably one thing I 'd look at .
I think another thing I 'd look at is safety .
Yeah .
That 's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about .
Actually , the car , one of the cars we 'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one Ford Taurus cause they 're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual --
Huh .
-- side air bags .
That 's a real nice car , I think .
Yeah .
I 've driven some , uh , Tauruses over the last couple of years when I 've been on business trips .
Uh-huh .
Uh , as rental cars .
And I 've always been very impressed with the Taurus .
It 's a really nice car .
I think it 's very , it 's a stylish car both inside and out .
It 's comfortable to drive .
Uh , reasonable performance ,
and this is out in California where , where they do n't make a car that 's got reasonable performance anymore .
Yeah .
Uh , I 've been real impressed with that .
Yo- ,
and I did n't realize that they were putting dual , uh , air bags in that car now .
Ninety ,
yeah .
Or , excuse me , the ninety-twos .
The --
Uh-huh .
-- ninety-twos had dual air bags .
This newest model .
You could --
Oh , I think that ,
-- get them with duals .
That 's excellent .
That 's excellent because ,
Yeah .
But the thing is that it 's twenty thousand dollars .
Actually , my , my wife and I are actually thinking , contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so .
So we 're actually --
Oh .
-- been looking around and thinking about things .
We 'd like to get like a
oh , I do n't know .
What do you call it ?
A dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know .
Uh-huh .
Year old ninety-two or something like that .
Uh-huh .
Sure .
Those are --
See if we ,
-- yeah ,
that , that would be a good deal to go with .
And the other thing we 're looking at is the Saturns too .
Okay .
Because they looked really nice .
Uh-huh .
What do you , what do you looking for in , in those ?
What , what attracts you to the Saturns ?
Or , or , of course , we 've already talked , you know ,
the Taurus is safe .
But wh , what kind of things are you looking for ?
Well , the Saturns you can get air bags in them .
I do n't think you can get dual side air bags .
Uh-huh .
But one of the , the two things that I 'm really ,
the , the I 'd say the most important thing is a car that 's not going to fall apart . That does n't have problems .
Uh-huh .
You set down .
You look at consumer reports .
We 've been pouring over consumer reports
and you just get so depressed for the U S auto --
Yeah .
-- makers when you do that .
Because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have
and , and the two cars that apparently are close to that . That actually have high reliability , the Taurus is one of the highest U S cars .
Uh-huh .
And the other one is , are the Saturns .
Uh-huh .
So those two things .
And then , you know , we kind of want a four door .
Okay .
Okay .
What is your , uh , community , uh , currently doing with regard to recycling ?
Uh , basically , they 're just , uh , having various recycling , uh , bins , uh , located for , uh , trash pickup .
Uh-huh .
Well that 's more than we have up here in Massachusetts .
Some , some local communities are very active in that , uh , in that respect
and they do have bins set up .
But I live in a , a metropolitan area
and , uh , they 're not , uh , too inclined to do something as aggressive as that .
Well , here they and ,
uh , live in an apartment complex .
Uh-huh .
And they only have one set of recycling bins , one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters .
So a lot of the people who live up front do n't bother to recycle because , you know , it 's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins .
I , I know a lot , I think a lot of , uh , the , the issues with regard to recycling are that , uh , people have to be motivated to do , to do something like that because it does take extra effort .
Whether
and , and I think that , and I know Massachusetts has ,
a bottle bill was passed
and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now ,
and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably , believe it or not , is just to get the extra nickel at the , uh , the store and not , uh ,
that 's the majority of people that I know of anyways .
Where people are n't really , you know , eco conscious . It 's just the fact that it 's something they have to do .
And I 'm not going to throw a bottle away ,
it 's like throwing a nickel away .
That type of thing .
Right .
They ,
But , uh , people need to be more conscious of it .
Th- , here they 're trying to push through a bill
and a lot of people are against it .
And it 's going to create a lot more work for the , uh , the stores that sell , you know , sodas and stuff .
Because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything .
Yeah .
MUMBLEx It did n't , it , it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans .
Uh , and , and matter of fact , I think it took like three tries t- , for it to go through .
But , and it 's been pretty successful
and people notice it as far as , uh , highways being , uh , you know ,
people would dr , have a drink of soda ,
instead of throwing out the window , they , they keep the bottle
so it 's , it 's been a ecologically sound policy and , you know , as , as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth .
But more importantly , it 's recycling reusable materials back into , uh , manufacturing .
And that 's the big thing , I think , that th , they try to promote .
Right .
I think here if they , uh , instead of just , you know , requiring that you put , put out the trash and stuff , if they could get some kind of rebate , those people who do put the stuff out , uh , you know , and separate it , have lower collection fee or something may --
Yeah ,
that 's a good idea .
-- encourage --
Yeah .
-- people to separate .
Th- , there definitely has to be a motivation factor
and I know that , at w , where I work ,
I work for a defense contractor .
And there 's a big push on for recycling , uh , paper materials , you know , computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of , uh , Styrofoam usage because of the , uh , the process involved in Styrofoam and , and the whole eco issue and that .
And , and they 're very proactive
and , uh , matter of fact , they give you discounts if you use , uh , china wear rather than , uh , Styrofoam stuff ,
so . So , i- , i- , it 's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it .
I think that 's , that 's what they need to do . Be more proactive like that .
Uh , I know , uh , I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books .
Uh , usually have them come from MUMBLEx you know , projects to collect old ones .
Usually just get dumped out with the trash .
And phone books are a large volume of annual trash .
Yeah .
They , they just ,
matter of fact , that , that reminded me of an article I saw in the pa- ,
the local schools , you could send your phone book to your , uh , to , with your kid to school
and what they 'll do is they 'll recycle it .
Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that , uh , trash , uh , the telephone books are the type of thing that do n't break down over a long period of time .
A guy went to a d- , a landfill , dug down five feet and , and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty
because they do n't , they do n't degrade over such a period of time .
Well , part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper .
Yeah .
They contain the glue and stuff
and they used to have to take out all the , uh , pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them .
Yeah .
Now I think they 've come up with some way of , uh , pulling the glue out .
Yeah .
Okay .
Uh , let 's see .
How about , uh , let 's see , about ten years ago ,
uh , what do you think was different ten years ago from now ?
Well , I would say as , far as social changes go , uh , I think families were more together .
They , they did more things together .
Uh-huh .
Uh , they ate dinner at the table together .
Uh , the parents usually took out time , uh , you know , more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity .
Uh-huh .
Uh , although I 'm not a mother , I , I still think that , uh , a lot has changed since ten years ago .
Uh , what do you --
We ,
-- think about that ?
Well , uh , actually ten years from today seems rather short .
Yeah .
Uh , but I do agree that , uh , generally it 's , society has sort of , uh , let 's see , rushed everything ahead .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , I do n't know ,
it leaves , leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that .
In other words , they just prioritize their lives differently .
But I think that has a lot to do with economic situation .
Yes .
What about like as far as , uh , social changes in the individual ?
Do --
Uh ,
-- you think that the individual has as much time as they did , let 's say , ten , twenty years ago ?
Um . It depends .
Uh , it 's hard to say because I think people were busy ten twenty years ago too .
Uh-huh .
Uh , I just ,
Well , how , how old are you ?
I 'm twenty-eight .
Twenty-eight .
Okay ,
I 'm twenty-three .
Yeah .
So there 's maybe a five year gap between us .
Yeah .
So , uh .
I just , I think that things were a bit , were , have been busy all along .
It 's just --
Huh .
-- a matter where priorities are , at placed .
Yes .
And that , uh , usually as far as families are concerned , there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home .
Uh-huh .
And now , uh , it 's pretty much an economic necessity of , for most , in most places for both parents to work .
Do you think it 's an economic c- , necessity
or do you think that we 're , we 're , uh , all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living ?
I think that 's part of it too .
But I do think ,
I mean do you think ,
.
people really need two cars and --
No ,
no .
I do n't .
-- a house in the suburbs or ,
No ,
I do n't think that .
But then there are a lot of people that , that do n't have that .
Uh-huh .
But , that really do need to work .
Uh-huh .
I think maybe those people that really do need to work , both parents , just to survive .
And --
Yeah .
-- then there , th- , is , is that other group that is --
Uh-huh .
-- working to maintain a standard of living --
Okay .
-- that , uh , they think is , is surviving which is really more luxuries .
Uh-huh .
Uh , but I I tend to think that it 's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive .
Yo- , so you think it 's ,
which group are you saying is the one trying ?
I 'm saying that the , uh , the group that is just trying to survive from day to day , where both parents are working --
Uh-huh .
-- is more of the majority than the , than the people that have the higher standard of living .
Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing , uh , middle class in this country --
Uh-huh .
-- I think that that 's , in my opinion , the case .
Okay .
So .
I mean I have met people that , uh , both that , that just want to maintain a , the standard of living and those that , that really need the job .
Okay .
And then , sometimes I , I often , uh , find that maybe there 's so many different things available to us . Yo- , a microwave , a V C R , a answering machine --
Uh-huh .
-- a , you know , a special , a dishwasher , uh , a refrigerator and some of those items , um , for the , for the , uh ,
well I guess we 're sticking more to social changes
but , uh --
Uh-huh .
-- people want all of that
and not all of those are necessities .
Right .
So they 're trying to ,
it has become a necessity .
Okay .
I say they , uh ,
probably the best things to do is , is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water
if they sink --
I see .
A --
-- they 're innocent right .
-- a good , a good southern solution .
Yeah .
Uh , so , uh , how do you , how do you feel ?
Th- , that 's , of course , being facetious
but .
Uh-huh .
You 'd have to say that .
.
Uh , I do n't know .
The , the things they asked to talk about were whether the , uh , whether the judge should be the one that does the , uh , sentencing .
Uh-huh .
And seems to me that that 's , I think that 's the way it 's done now .
Uh , at least ,
.
my understanding of the law which is n't very good .
Uh-huh .
Uh , it seems to me that the judge does it
and I , I think that 's probably all right in that they , you know , maybe know what the , the norm is --
Uh-huh .
-- for a particular thing .
And , I guess , also what the system will absorb .
Right .
Probably more tuned in to that .
Possibly though on , uh , capital cases like maybe the death penalty --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , I 'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole ,
I mean he could have like a personal prejudice .
You know , judges are people like everybody else --
That 's right .
-- even though they 're , they 're supposed to be impartial
but maybe , uh ,
And I think that may , I , that may be an exception as well .
Because I think that ,
does n't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than , than the judge ?
I , I think that 's , I think that 's the way it is .
Yeah .
Uh , whether they , they decide whether or not they , uh , the accused or whatever would get the , uh , get the death penalty .
Do they have a death penalty in California ? .
Yes .
In --
Yeah .
-- fact , they 're going to execute somebody at the end of this month .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , there 's a big uproar going on right now . Uh --
Yeah .
.
-- the , uh , Governor , you know , has been trying to decide whether he 's going to commute it or not .
Uh-huh .
You know , it 's someone who had , uh ,
.
killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact .
Yeah .
I ,
something like that , I 've got no problem with it . Uh --
Yeah .
-- I guess the way I think about it is not , it should n't necessarily be thought of as revenge .
It 's just like if you 've got like a dog that 's running wild and biting people --
Uh-huh .
-- put it to sleep , you know .
Just get it out , you know ,
it 's not able to fit in , you know .
Something inexpensive .
Yeah .
Yeah ,
exactly .
Uh , I guess ,
.
kind of the way I think about it also , is they just ,
if somebody gets the death penalty , they 're , they 're judged guilty ,
they got the death penalty ,
they should have one year and one appeal . Cover all their bases with one appeal
and if not , you know , do n't , do n't let them sit up there on death row for , you know , fifteen years .
Yeah .
I think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years .
Uh-huh .
Yeah ,
that ,
But I guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake
and --
Yeah .
Oh , I 'm sure .
-- you 'd hate to be one of those .
Yeah .
The other thing they asked about was whether uh , uh , the verdict should be required to be unanimous .
Uh-huh .
Which , again , I think is the way it is now . That all the , all verdicts ,
well maybe not .
I do n't know .
At least in capital cases I 'd think they 'd have to be --
I believe it is --
-- unanimous .
-- in capital .
I think in like , uh , lesser cases it 's like ten out of twelve or five out of six , whatever .
Uh-huh .
How ever many is on , sitting on a jury .
I t- , I believe that 's the way it is .
But I 'm pretty sure you 're correct on capital cases . Uh ,
Yeah .
The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial .
Uh-huh .
And that there 's one juror that is , is , uh , different than the other eleven .
Yeah .
And , uh , they 've only deliberated four hours or ,
.
something
and they say they 're hopelessly deadlocked .
Oh , no .
And the judge told them ,
.
they were n't hopelessly deadlocked yet .
I 'm telling you , go one way or the other .
That , that 's probably an expensive trial . Uh ,
Yeah .
Six months so far they said .
Yeah .
Probably .
So .
Yeah .
Probably .
You know , I 'm not sure there 's a number .
It 's probably like thirty , forty thousand dollars a day you know , worth of all the free for all .
Maybe they could go with a , with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their , uh , vote .
Yeah .
Yeah ,
that 's , that 's been so long I 've prac- , practically forgot who Noriega was , you know .
Right .
That has been going on .
My , uh , cousin is a F B I agent down in Miami .
Oh really ?
Yeah .
So she follows that stuff pretty closely .
But , uh ,
That 's interesting .
Yeah ,
she 's not involved in that , that case .
But she does ,
Well have you ever served on a jury ?
No
I have n't .
I never have .
My wife has
but I , I have n't .
Uh-huh .
I got called
but I , uh , never , uh , got selected for a jury ,
Uh-huh .
I sat for tw- , ten days --
Uh-huh .
-- in a court room while they went through the selection process ,
.
and they had some guy that was , uh , defending himself .
Uh-huh .
Bye .
So we 're , uh , our discussion 's about , uh , the care of the elderly ?
That 's right ,
that 's right .
You know , what , what , uh , what do you think is important ?
If you were ,
uh , I do n't know how , how old you are ,
but if you had , if you had , uh , parents say or , or , or th- , grandparents , whatever it is , uh , who were ready ,
.
who , who you thought might benefit from a nursing home , what do you think you would look for ?
Uh , well I , actually my dad 's , my dad 's almost ninety
and --
Huh .
-- he lives by himself
and he 's in good shape .
Yeah .
Uh , but , uh , some friends of mine have , uh , gone through this .
I think I 'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and , uh , where they did some things to try to keep them , um , mentally alive .
Yeah .
And where there was , uh , caring and compassionate , where there were caring and compassionate people , uh , operating it .
Do --
Huh .
-- you have any experience with this yourself ?
Well my , uh , uh , my wife 's grandmother --
Uh-huh .
-- is in a nursing home in , uh , Minnesota
and we go there , uh , once a year .
We see , we tend to see her there cause we 're in Boston
so we 're pretty far away .
When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her .
Uh-huh .
And it seems , uh ,
I mean the , the environment there , I do n't know too much about it
but it , it seems nice enough .
Uh , it , it 's hard ,
at least half of the residents I would say are not , not mentally sound .
So it 's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to r , to retain , uh , clarity , say , uh , you know .
From the lack of stimulation , you mean .
Yeah .
Well I , I don- , I do n't know .
We , we also , my wife and I , uh , uh , volunteer to go to a , uh , nursing home that 's just a mile from our house .
We , uh , she goes more often than I .
We used to go once a month , once every two months to visit some of the patients there .
And we 'd take , we have a two year old son
and so we , sometimes we 'd take him with us .
And , uh , there I would say it 's the same thing .
It 's , it 's a nice , uh , relatively nice environment
but again , um , it must be depressing for the people who , who are , who are just e- , e- , essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but , but , certainly , uh , certainly have ar , ar , are , have retained all of their , uh , mental skills and so on .
It 's , must be depressing to , to walk , walk the halls and see , an- , and see all these other people who really do n't know where they are .
Do you think that in the case of the one that you 've actually had some experience with , that the people who operate it seem to have , what you 'd perceive of as genuine concern ?
I think , yeah ,
I think they 're relatively re , respectful . Yeah and , and concerned that , in as much as they can be .
I , I think sometimes , you know , I 've noticed , uh , people asking for , uh , some of the patients asking for things , uh , just repetitively --
Uh-huh .
-- and , but things that are not reasonable ,
and so --
Yeah .
-- at some level the , the , the , uh ,
I 'm sure that the , that the , uh , the staff l , learn what 's normal for this person
and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person 's needs is really because this person is just , you know , is just in a state where they do n't really need what they think they need , you know .
Yeah .
It , it 's possible ,
I was thinking also that there 'd be , there could be a fair burn out factor --
Oh , yeah .
-- um , in just having to respond to people 's needs where the needs are sometimes , depending on the person , not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need .
Yeah .
I 'll tell you one thing though that 'll , that , that I , I saw that was really nice .
We saw a husband and wife ,
we used to see a husband and wife in there , uh , together
and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were
but these two were .
Uh-huh .
And when you walked into their room , they had brought all their furniture from their house --
Uh-huh .
So it --
-- And so ,
-- gives them a sense of identity .
Yeah ,
you walked in there
and it did n't look like , uh , you know , how , yo- , you , you walk into some rooms
and there 's , it 's completely generic .
There 's nothing , maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person
and that 's it .
But this room , on the other hand , you know , they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that
and they had all their stuff from their house
and it looked like , uh , i- , i- , it must have been ,
it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them
and it must also give them a sense of , uh , uh , security and , and , uh , and , and , you know , s- , s- , uh ,
Yeah ,
I , I think part of what you 're saying matches what I h , have read .
I used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who , uh , were adequately deficient in their abilities , uh --
Yeah .
-- physical or mental , that they could n't take care of themselves .
But I also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because I think they provide , um , a lot of social activities .
Huh .
Yeah .
Uh , the , one of my friend 's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities
and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation .
Uh , and ,
Huh .
MUMBLEx temporary .
I ,
that , that 's , that 's new to me .
I ,
Well I think it , I think t- , it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there
and I feel like , the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like , like put her in there .
Right ,
right .
And there , there 's so much ,
.
Okay .
Uh , so your , you , I guess you 're probably in the same , uh , same situation uh , we 're in .
We 're kind of past having to provide child care .
Our , our kids are grown up .
We do n't have any grandchildren yet .
But , uh , uh , they 're ,
Uh-huh .
How old are your children ?
Uh , one 's twenty-six
and the other is , uh , twenty , twenty-one .
Uh-huh .
So they 're , uh , uh ,
Well , they 're going to be getting there .
They 're , they 're getting there .
You know , there 's no --
Yeah .
-- no , no prospects right away for anything to happen .
U- , uh-huh .
Oh , I see .
But , uh ,
I have , uh , five children .
I have a eighteen year old son .
The rest of my girls are like twenty-three , twenty-six , twenty-eight , and twenty-nine .
Uh-huh .
And I have three granddaughters right now .
Oh .
And , uh , I , uh ,
one 's in Iowa .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , she 's , she 's a teacher
and what she does is she ,
.
teaches at a preschool .
Oh , okay .
And , and so she kind of ,
and they let her bring her , her little daughter in for free .
Uh-huh .
And then , so MUMBLEx
but she just works part-time .
Uh-huh .
Then I have another daughter in , uh , Bountiful , Utah
and she has to work full-time
and it 's just tearing her apart .
She has a private baby-sitter .
Yeah .
And , uh , the baby just screams .
I mean , the baby is like seventeen months
and she just screams .
Uh-huh .
Well even if she knows that they 're fixing to get ready to go over there .
They 're not even there yet --
Uh-huh .
-- you know .
Yeah .
It 's hard .
We ,
And , and then I have my , uh , uh , I have a seven month old granddaughter
and , uh , her mother stays home
and she , they live , they live with us . You know , in , as Orange County --
Uh-huh .
-- is really expensive .
Uh-huh .
They live with us
and so , of course , we love it . Because we get to see this cute little baby all the time .
But , uh , uh , she just ,
uh , she used to work in pre , in the preschool and , and , and child care
and she says after working in there
and , and , you know , here she was a provider
but , you know , there 's only so much one person can do .
Yeah .
She said it 's so awful .
She said she 'll never put her child in a , in a , in a preca- , in a p- , in a preschool .
Uh-huh .
I 'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere .
Huh .
But it 's really , it 's really , really very difficult
and ,
Yeah .
What did you do when your kids were growing up ?
Were you ,
Well , when , when
the , uh , the first , uh , ten years , see first ten or twelve years , I stayed home .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , then after that I , I went to work .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , uh , uh , a couple of times I just , uh , uh , you know ,
th- , then I had one job
and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job .
And then , and then like about , later I , I tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter .
Supposed to be good , uh , recommended person from the church
and I knew her personally .
She had two kids of her own and everything .
But I quit my job because I could n't stand how she was taking care of my child .
Uh-huh .
I mean , first of all , uh , her children were sick all the time .
So when my son stayed over there , he got sick .
He got sick ,
yeah .
Same thing , same thing that the , her kids had ,
right ?
Right .
Well ,
And so , uh , we did n't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock .
Then he , she 'd take my son and her daughter over t- , to kindergarten .
But s- ,
that day , uh , I was saying now he , he 's sick .
And she goes well , she goes , he has the same thing that all my kids have .
That 's what he got , you know .
Goes , well , okay ,
so it 's not like he 's going to infect her kids .
But then what happened was , is , I said , uh , he just threw up
and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty
so she said well she 'll keep him home
and he 'll probably just sleep anyway .
.
Well , you know , what
that woman sent her , sent him to kindergarten .
She sent him to kindergarten .
As soon as he went there , the teacher took one look at him
and he threw up again
and they put him in the nursery , uh , they put him in the nurse 's office .
Guess so ,
yeah .
And then what happened was , is , you know , they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter .
Called her
and they said , uh , that he 's sick .
Well she was n't home .
Huh .
I mean her , all her kids were sick
but she was n't home , right .
And her , and her , her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick .
Now why did n't he , why did n't she keep him home with her ?
No ,
she did n't do that .
So , it got to the point where he 's , he 's supposed to get out of , uh , kindergarten like about two thirty .
And I had to leave work .
It was , it was five o'clock in the evening
and I found out he was still there at school .
And they were calling me
and they said somebody 's got to pick him up .
And I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up , she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school .
I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff .
And he had a hundred and four fever .
They could n't , uh , give him anything because they 're not allowed to at school and everything .
Right .
I was so furious .
I , I quit that job
and I stayed home for awhile longer .
Then I went and got a , uh , a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my time a little bit better .
Yeah ,
a little more flexibility .
You can come and go .
Yeah ,
but , uh , I have n't had any good , really very good experience with child care .
Yeah .
When , when our kids were small we had a couple of , uh , good , good women who , uh , would often c , uh , get them to come to the house .
So , who 's your favorite team ?
My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers .
Pittsburgh ?
You bet .
I used to be a big Pittsburgh fan when I was little .
Well , I , uh ,
when John Stallworth played he was from my hometown in Alabama ,
Oh , really ?
so I kind of grabbed on to that team ,
Huh .
That 's pretty nice .
way back when .
Yeah ,
that 's good .
I , I used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big iron curtain ,
That 's right .
or steel curtain .
How about your favorite team ?
Huh .
Well , last year it was Buffalo
and I , I still try to keep up with Buffalo because they just , they just impressed me as being so efficient
and they never score .
They never blow out their opponents .
They just score just enough points ,
Uh-huh .
and that really impressed me .
But then down here I li- ,
MUMBLEx is pretty close to New Orleans
and I 've been keeping up with the Saints a lot .
Well , they are exciting , are n't they ?
Yeah ,
the Saints are starting to impress me this year , you know , a lot .
Boy ,
they are , they are just a fun team to watch .
This , it , they are really .
Did you see the game Sunday night or ,
Uh ,
Sunday afternoon ?
no ,
I did n't .
It was funny .
There were , they ha , uh , a fireworks display at halftime .
Oh , yeah ?
Yeah ,
and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire .
Oh , you 're kidding .
So , they had to stop the game in lieu of the third quarter --
Oh , my gos- ,
-- and put out this fire .
Those big piece of something came flaming , falling out of the roof and landed on the field
so there 's this big fire on the field
and they were dumping the Gatorade bucket and everything .
Oh , I ca n't believe that .
It was funn ,
I mean , you just really ca n't tell what 's going to happen .
That 's hilarious .
I know .
It 's like about two weeks ago I was watching the Saints .
Uh-huh .
And Morton Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal .
Oh .
And it , it was beautiful , right down the middle .
Oh , boy .
He is tough ,
he has --
He is .
-- an incredible leg .
Yes .
Well , do you think they 're , they 're going to be able to make it this year ,
Uh I s- ,
past the first playoff game ?
I sure hope so .
I 'm not sure , I 'm not sure who they play .
Right now I 've got it narrowed down to the top four teams .
Who 's that ?
It 's pretty much going between Washington . They are undefeated .
Right .
And , uh , Buffalo , New Orleans , and Chicago because Chicago has only lost twice
and one of those was to Buffalo .
And they beat the Saints .
Their only time they lost .
What do you think about , uh , Houston ?
Houston .
I saw Houston play this summer in Memphis .
Oh , yeah ?
Yeah .
Uh , from what I saw they were playing ,
when I was at the game we sat right on the front row ,
Huh .
right behind the Houston Oilers ,
and from what I saw the game Houston , Houston impressed me a lot .
Huh .
But my brother watched it on T V and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night ,
and if that was an off night I 'd hate to see when he 's on a good night .
Oh , yeah ,
he 's --
He 's ,
-- he definitely , uh , is one of the best I think .
Yeah ,
the , their , their backfield is really impressive .
Haywood Jeffreys and Drew Hill --
Right .
-- and Allen MUMBLEx ,
they really impress me .
Well , they squeaked out a game on Sunday .
That 's right .
Who , who did they play ?
They played Dallas .
Dallas ,
that 's right ,
They won ,
all because ,
in overtime .
That 's right .
I remember that now .
So that was ,
I , I watched that game
and , uh , that was , uh ,
Do you have a favorite between those two ?
Well , because I 'm right here in Dallas I , I kind of pull for Dallas .
Really ? .
Yeah .
Well , also Houston is , uh , in Pittsburgh 's division
so ,
Well , that 's true .
I 'll almost always root against them .
MUMBLEx .
.
I hate to say it
but I hate Dallas .
That 's okay .
Well I , you know , I , I was never really a big Dallas fan --
Yeah .
-- until we moved here
and they just kind of grew on me .
Yeah ,
I imagine .
That 's the way ,
I 've never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two
and they , they 've actually started doing something .
Yeah .
Yeah .
So , I 've actually pl- , paid attention to them .
Well ,
Well , do you know anything about the expansion teams they 're thinking about bringing in ?
To tell you the truth I have n't paid too much attention to that .
Really ?
Um , what cities are they looking at ?
Uh , right now I think this Memphis , they 're , they 're trying to get the teams .
Uh-huh .
And that 's , that 's where I was when I saw , uh ,
Uh-huh .
Houston play .
Saint Louis is trying to get a team .
Uh , Baltimore is trying to get a team ,
and there 's some other city .
I 'm wanting to say Raleigh Durham
but I 'm not sure .
You know , I think you are right .
I think it is Raleigh .
Think so ?
I think I remember hearing that .
Uh-huh .
Because I know they 've got a MUMBLEx football team
but I think it might be them .
That would be fun .
I 'd like to see some more teams get in .
I would , definitely .
I think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after .
And right now I think Memphis and , it 's Memphis and I think Baltimore have a really good shot at it .
Uh-huh .
Because I know Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis
and when I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did .
Oh , really ?
Yeah .
It 's like the Liberty Bowl or Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty-two ,
I think that , uh , one , uh , advantage of having , uh , the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you do n't , uh , convict someone who , uh , really should n't be convicted .
Definitely .
Um , and I think that , you know , a unanimous verdict , uh , helps to ensure that .
I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way , that , uh , you , uh , would have a problem , uh , you know , that you would n't convict someone who maybe should be convicted .
Uh-huh .
Have you ever served on a jury before ?
Uh , I have twice .
Oh , okay .
It was a pretty wild experience .
Uh , what sorts of cases were they ?
They were just , you know , small time cases where , uh , trailers and banks were involved , you know .
So were they criminal or civil ?
They were civil .
They were n't --
Oh , okay .
-- they were n't any criminal .
What , uh , what was the verdict ?
Did the , did the jury have trouble reaching a decision ?
Uh , the jury , it was , uh , let me see , I think it was ten to one on the jury , because they only had to have eleven people --
Yeah .
-- so it was ,
they ,
and , uh , the one changed his vote at the end .
So did it become ?
So it became unanimous , you know , after they turned it in --
Yeah .
-- and then he changed his mind after they turned it in --
Uh .
-- but it then became unanimous .
Uh . But since it was a civil case it really did n't matter , right ?
You just needed a majority ?
Right .
What was , what was the other case ?
That was also civil ?
The , the other case was just traffic ,
the ,
and , you know , it was seat belt law --
Yeah .
-- and it , it did n't even hardly --
Oh , did n't really even count .
-- go through ,
so .
Yeah .
I 'm , I 'm a college student
so I have n't been , you know , a jury eligible age for very long --
Yeah .
-- um , and , uh , I did get one summons actually at one point ,
but I declined it which I 'm able to do because I 'm a student , because it was , uh , a very bad time .
Yeah .
Well , you learn a lot going to the juries like that though .
Yeah , I mean , I , I really , I would like to , uh , to do at some point , um ,
but , I , I have n't .
Uh , one , one thing that I , I think is , um , you know , maybe is a problem is , uh , I , I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now ,
but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it does n't work as well .
Especially sort of .
I would n't think that it does --
How , wha ,
-- I mean , from , from my , from what I experienced in them ,
it did n't , you know , it did n't turn out the way I planned it , I mean , the way that I would think that it would go .
Uh , you thought it turned out pretty well ?
Yeah ,
but it was , you know , it was ,
jury was unorganized
and it was , it was just was n't organized enough for me .
Yeah .
I 'm not used to it not being organized ,
and I just assumed that it would have been .
Oh , so it was just kind of a zoo
and the jurors just sort of ,
someone had to figure out what was going on ?
That 's about what it was .
Um . That 's interesting .
Did it , did it work out pretty well in the end ?
I mean , did a couple of people sort of gradually , sort of assume , uh , sort of a moderator role in the trial
or ,
Yeah ,
they , well they picked one person ,
and then he finally , you know , moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have .
So it work- , it did end up working out pretty well ?
Yeah ,
it ended up working all right .
The one thing I sometimes wonder about , um , in civil cases is , uh , whether , especially sort of in , uh , maybe like pro- , product liability , or medical malpractice , where there 's , um , sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes --
Yes .
-- you know , it 's not just a matter of , um , of , you know , did this guy rip off this guy ,
and it 's just a matter of interpreting a contract ,
it 's sort of a matter of , um , you know , sometimes getting into very technical issues ,
and I wonder if , uh , if there 's really , um , if the system works adequately in , in educating the jurors about , uh , whatever , um , you know , issue is under discussion .
I , I do n't think that they , they , they educate them enough to , to really know what 's going on .
In , in the case you were involved in , you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind .
So .
Yeah ,
the , the bank was suing them for , uh , because they went to get the , the trailer --
Yeah .
-- that , which was , uh , seemingly their property .
Uh .
It was on his property .
Oh , so the deal was that he had , uh , borrowed money from the bank to buy it ,
and --
Right .
-- he had n't made the payments .
So they came to get it .
Yeah .
And then when they came to get it , well , it was on the landlord 's property
and he would n't let them take it off .
Uh , so they were suing to get it back .
So , and they are , it was a double wide ,
so they 'd already taken it apart .
Uh .
So they left it there --
Yeah .
-- and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it .
Uh .
So they were suing him for the money ,
and , you know , there 's no way they could because it , it was the moving company ,
Uh , I get most of my news uh , from newspapers really .
I read the daily newspaper , uh , the HOUSTON CHRONICLE
and sometimes I 'll read like the , uh , WALL STREET or the NEW YORK TIMES .
I do n't subscribe to either ,
but sometimes I get a hold of copies of it .
Uh , how about you ?
Do you , uh , mostly --
Yes .
-- get things from T V or MUMBLEx .
I actually get most of my news coverage off uh , computer networks .
However , I do also watch television news , uh , usually in the morning once a day
and I read the front page of the WALL STREET JOURNAL --
Oh .
-- most every day .
Oh that 's interesting .
You said computer networks .
Uh , what , uh , what sort .
I am fairly knowledgeable of MUMBLEx .
Uh well , well DOW JONES for example have the , cause the --
Uh , okay .
That 's interesting .
-- uh , news wire
and it 's picked up and actually available , uh , at my office ,
so , it 's , no fee , or subscription either to read at my leisure
and it 's sort of by category .
For example --
Oh .
I- , --
-- so I can read a certain business or topics .
-- is it ,
.
is it the A P news wire
or is it something that is , uh , a little bit different from that ?
Well , uh , it 's similar to that ,
but it 's DOW JONES , which is , uh , the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire .
Uh , okay .
So , that 's that 's interesting .
Okay .
Yeah ,
I 've had , I had access in the past to , uh , uh , the A P news wire
and I thought that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news .
Uh , I 've never used the DOW JONES news wire
but , uh ,
yeah
it , uh ,
do you get any , uh , do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader , like more long term analytical sort of approach ?
Uh , well actually not .
Uh , I do , uh , follow , uh , uh , uh ,
I do n't know how to how to describe it
so I 'll say a religious newspaper which , which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense .
It 's a weekly --
Yeah .
-- but , uh , but not , uh , not like BUSINESS WEEK or NEWS WEEK or one of those kinds of things .
I 'd like to say that however , uh , that I 'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires .
In what way ?
In like , in sort of like , uh , qual- , uh , quality or sort of an orientation in terms of like , view point or the way the news is presented or whatever ?
Uh , I think that it , I think that it has to do with , uh ,
I personally think , uh ,
I , I have a problem with their viewpoint
and I personally think that , uh , ther- , --
Yeah .
Well you wo n't offend me .
So go ahead and say .
-- that there 's a strong bia- , there 's a strong bias in the media .
Yeah .
Like a liberal type of bias .
Yeah .
Absolutely .
Uh , after all , who , who writes .
People who are journalist who are trained to write
and they 're , that 's a liberal , uh , a liberal field --
Yeah .
-- at least from academia
and , uh , the other thing that I always notice is that whenever they write about something that I 'm an expert in , I find their descriptions to be wrong --
Yeah .
Yeah .
-- and it ,
They , they generally make mistake on anything technical at least .
That 's right .
Well , even if it 's not technical . If it 's , uh , some social thing or whatever . It does n't matter .
If I am an expert in it , they usually make mistakes which makes me believe think I 'm not expert in it .
They 're telling me lies .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Do you , by mistakes , do you mean just like honest mistakes
or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things ?
Uh , I think both .
Uh , by deliberate I , uh , I mean mistake , mistakes of omission or , uh , or , uh , biased toward a particular view point --
Yeah .
Yeah .
-- a particular liberal --
Yeah .
-- view point that they have .
Yeah .
So , uh , uh , to give you an example , uh , we will go out of the printing media .
I know of cases where , uh , we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but , with the the attempt to give you the impression that what they 're talking about is the same thing they are showing you .
Huh .
Which is sort of like a deliberate bias .
Huh . That 's disturbing .
Which is which is rather disturbing .
I mean he does that .
I have n't really noticed them doing that ,
but whatever ,
again I do n't watch T V news that much now .
If I had access to C N N , I would watch T V news more .
Uh , I do n't you know , but I do n't usually .
Yeah ,
I do n't have access either . Although , I did at one time
and it was ,
I did during the Gulf War
and it was addictive .
Yeah .
Did you , did you think that C N N , well , the Gulf War coverage would be kind of , uh , an abnormality ?
I just wonde , I guess .
I would be curious to know what you thought as to how like say C N N T V news compared to the three networks .
Uh , you know whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever
but I , I guess you would n't .
You probably ,
if you just watched it during the Gulf War , that probably would n't would n't tell you much .
Yeah ,
well during that small sample , I would think that everyone was just about , just about the same , except the three networks , MUMBLEx radio television programming .
Yeah .
So , if at a particular time , you wanted to get the latest and greatest news --
Yeah .
-- you could do that by , uh , turning on C N N
and you ,
Anyway , uh .
How about you .
What do you do with your budget ?
What do I do ,
uh , at the moment it 's under chaos .
Uh , right now I 'm just , uh ,
I , I do n't really have a budget per se .
I 'm , I , uh , it 's called living within your means .
Uh-huh .
You know , which means at the moment , paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car does n't collapse .
Yeah .
That 's true .
Uh , but , uh , no
I do n't really have a budget at the moment .
Uh , but I have uh , I have a rough feel for how much money I can afford to spend each month
and then I do n't , usually do n't exceed that unless I , unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another , like if I have car expenses
and then that , then it goes through the moon ,
so .
Yeah ,
that 's sort of a problem .
Yeah ,
so uh , what do yo- ,
We 're trying , we 're trying to , uh ,
so far we are in the clear credit wise
but , uh , the other side of it is ,
so , not much on that side of it to add to it .
We 're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that
but ,
So you can afford to get a house ?
Yeah ,
we 'd like to do that some day .
.
We have this dream .
Yeah .
But , we do n't know how long it will be a dream .
.
We , we 're kind of real , we 're real happy that we do n't have any debt ,
but we 're at the same time we 're real scared about incurring it in this , uh , economy right now
so --
Yeah .
-- we 're stepping real careful and trying to see what 's the best way to save what , the little bit that we do get , you know , on top of expenses every month .
So , what do you and your husband do ?
We 're missionaries actually .
Are you really ?
Yeah ,
uh-huh .
And , uh , it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have , uh , like , uh , uh , support quota --
Um .
-- and it 's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here .
No kidding .
And it does n't get switched very easily once you come home .
I see .
So ,
Overseas , where would you be going ?
Africa ,
Nigeria .
Really .
Yeah .
Really .
How long would you be there ?
About four years .
We 're career
so , we , we go over seas for four years
and then we come back for a year .
We go over four ,
we come back for a year .
With , with what Church ?
Uh , we 're with Wycliff Bible Translators .
Oh yes .
Yes , --
So .
-- I , uh , I know who they are .
They , uh , they have an office , uh , in in Costa Mesa as I recall .
Yeah ,
they could very well
and ,
There , there was , uh , you know , there was a fairly large building that that was well that belongs to them .
So , uh , are you , uh , are you , uh , active in translation ?
Uh , we will be .
I was over , over four years doing language surveying which is the first step .
You 're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , came home and got married
and we will go ba- , back as translators cause we want to raise a family
and it is easier to raise a family as translators .
Well , I always wanted to do translation ,
but as long as I was single and foot loose so to speak it 's easier .
You know they really need surveyors cause you could , you 're free to travel anywhere .
You do n't have kids hanging around you and stuff .
True ,
true enough .
So , uh , what , what , uh , what languages do you speak besides English , of course ?
Well , I have a smattering of about ten different ones ,
but there 's ,
I 'm not bilingual in any of them because I kept switching from one area to the other , you know ,
since I did --
Uh-huh .
-- you know , complete a survey in one area , I 'd switch to the other .
So I know the greetings in about ten ,
.
and how to do market stuff ,
but in about , uh , about five I guess , I can do better in it .
And my French is pretty good
but it 's , uh , MUMBLEx French
so , uh , I 'm terrified to speak in , uh --
In France .
-- in France .
Yeah ,
because they 're real snobby about their language
and MUMBLEx French is street French
and I just picked it up off the street
and I knew what I was , I knew what I was communicating ,
but I did n't know what I was saying .
I never sat there and got a direct translation
and said something here when I came home and French to somebody
and he paled and said , uh , I 'm not going to tell you what you said .
So , since then I have refrained from speaking any French .
.
So .
In MUMBLEx .
Uh ,
I do n't know what I said to him
but , uh , I did n't ask him either .
Must have been terrible .
The , uh ,
was it Henry Macon said that the , the , uh , language was like a man slowly bleeding to death .
So they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die
and I , it just amazes me that the French do n't recognize that .
Free style English is just ,
takes on ,
Uh , guy ,
uh , some of my things ,
I , I 'd like to have a short work week --
Oh , okay .
-- you know ,
and and we need , you know , better health insurance and you know , cau- ,
Okay ,
we can start off there .
Let 's just get started .
Okay .
If you do n't want to , you know , uh , talk about it now and then --
Okay .
-- be bored when we get to it .
Okay ,
so I just press one then
right ?
Right .
Okay ,
ready ?
Yep .
Okay .
So , so you think , uh , I think that a short work week is real nice .
Uh , I have a thirty-seven hour work week .
How about you ?
Well , well right now , I , I 'm just a student .
I only work part time ,
but I 've work in the job force before --
Uh-huh .
-- and forty hours is just too long .
You just do n't have any time to do anything .
It seems like , Saturday you get get off ,
but Sunday you 're getting ready for Monday .
And if we get have a --
Uh-huh .
-- if we could have a thirty-two hour work week , with that happen is that , for every four people we could give another job .
Right .
And then that way everybody would have a three day holiday , okay .
And that way that more , that would make a bigger market .
We 'd have , uh , more recreation .
People would have time to do it .
There would be less of a stress level .
We 'd have , we 'd have less crime .
We 'd have to we 'd have to build less prisons , you know , less police force .
Yeah ,
it all makes sense to me .
Although , there may be more crime . I mean if people have more leisure time .
It 's not clear .
And that ,
It , it , that 's , that 's a possibility .
Yeah .
One , one of the problems they 're facing now , a lot of people now , is that the health insurance is that the small business ca n't , ca n't offer health insurance --
Uh-huh .
-- and it , it 's too costly
and what , what is happening is that they 're on a policy where they have X amount of users in it , okay .
So they get a specific rate .
Well what happens is that if people start becoming having chronic illness and , and things like that ,
what happened and where they really have to spend out a lot of money --
Right .
-- for one particular ,
it 's called a a group ,
well what will , well what happens then is that they cancel , because they just ca n't cancel an individual .
So they , they have to cancel just like life insurance .
They have to cancel everything .
Uh-huh .
So what they do is that , that they cancel the insurance
and then all the people do n't have any insurance coverage .
Right .
So ,
But , I 'm , I 'm , you know , I 'm , I 'm satisfied with my job .
I 'm , I 'm an engineering student .
Right .
And I work for my instructor
and I 'm I 'm not a typical student .
I 'm , I 'm older .
I 'm , I 'm in my thirties , okay .
Yeah .
And so I have a lot of job experience
and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants
and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose --
Yeah .
-- but in , in the same token , it 's a very , really enjoyable for me because I do n't have to have , you know , nobody breathing down my back
and --
Uh-huh .
-- and one of the things that I , I really hate about jobs . I do n't , I do n't like bosses that , that you know want to yell at you and you know are down on your back and all this and that .
I , I just really ca n't deal with that
so ,
Yeah .
What kind of , what kind of jobs have you done ?
Well , well , I do wo- , uh , research in computer science
and I 've just been doing that for a few years now
so --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , I , my job has most of the benefits I want .
Uh , what I really like is , I like being ,
like they send me to conferences for instance , but probably not as much as I 'd like
but , uh , you know , that 's just nice being , you know , having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of ,
uh , they also ,
a really important thing to me is when they , uh , they pay for continuing education .
Like , I , I get night courses that they they 'll cover right now
and that 's really good
yeah .
Yeah ,
that 's just great .
You have what you might call knowledge power --
Right .
-- you know , when when you work at a company whether you know it or not , is that you 're categorized .
Some people can be let go and replaced like , uh , say , uh , a typist , uh , somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist .
But if you 're a person who , that 's doing computer type things and you have the , you have the knowledge , you know what the system you 've revised and revamped the system , well then you 're you 're vital to the company --
Uh-huh .
-- and you get more benefits
so . That 's where I , I , I 'm like ,
I 'm into computers too
and that 's one of the things that I 've found in any one , one of these jobs and anything I 've done is that to have knowledge .
When you have the knowledge , you 're you 're not going to , uh , you know , be let go ,
be one of the last ones to let go anyway .
Right .
So what I ,
Well , what were you saying ?
Okay .
I , I think we 're started now .
Oh , okay .
Uh , do you want to go ahead and start ?
Uh , well , I have n't really been up to date on a lot of music .
I 've been in school
and I have n't really gone out ,
.
and bought any or listened to much on the , on the radio except for classical
and , uh ,
Well , you like classical music ?
Yes .
Uh , I like classical music .
I like rock and roll .
Uh-huh .
I like country and western .
Okay .
Uh , I , I like all kinds .
I like , I like different things about each one of them .
Well , I like most of them except for country music .
Oh you do n't like country ?
No .
I think I , I might like dancing to it
but I do n't like listening to it .
The , the kind of country I like is kind of the older country music .
Whi , .
Not the , not the kind like Kenny Rodgers and stuff like that .
Oh .
That 's , uh , that 's a little bit to , uh ,
it 's such
they 're trying to make it too much of a crossover thing ,
you know what I mean ?
Uh-huh .
Wh , what 's the old country music like ?
Oh , like , like Hank Williams .
Like the old Hank Williams .
Even , even Hank --
Uh-huh .
-- Williams , Junior is real good stuff .
The kind that --
Oh , okay .
-- uh , this stuff ,
.
makes you cry it sounds so sad .
I mean you d- ,
That 's the kind you like you mean ?
Yeah .
Som- , sometimes I do .
I mean , not all the time .
Oh .
Oh , okay .
.
Well , I guess I , I like the blues a lot
and I guess you could say it 's similar as far as --
Yes .
And I --
-- the kind of ma- , the way they do it .
-- I , I do too .
I also like jazz .
Yeah .
Me too , too .
I guess I like
except heavy metal
and , uh , most rap I do n't like .
Yeah .
Yeah .
You 're , you 're about like I am then .
I , I ca n't ,
.
watch M T V anymore .
I used to love M T V .
Oh , okay .
And I can , I can barely watch anymore because , uh , they have this heavy metal stuff on there
and , and I ca n't even , you know , I ca n't like that .
Yeah .
And , and I liked , uh , Aerosmith and --
Uh-huh .
-- Led Zepplin and , uh --
Okay .
-- you know , and , uh , jeez who else is there . Van Halen .
Okay .
Yeah .
Now I like , I like groups like that .
But when you get , uh ,
I , I even like Guns and Roses , some of their stuff .
Uh-huh .
But , uh , some of these groups now like Slaughter .
Oh , I , I really have n't listened to that .
Some of them are just really rough .
So , so you went to school then in ,
I 'm surprised you did n't go to , to any pa- , parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff
or ,
Well , uh , I used to a long time ago
but since I 've started back into school now , I have n't really done that much .
I 've been pretty busy . Uh --
Okay .
-- but , uh ,
so no
I have n't .
I , you know , I used to go out and dance a lot
but I do n't do that anymore either .
So .
Oh , I see .
Are you married at all ?
No .
Okay .
I 've just been real busy with , with lots of other things .
Well , how old are you ?
Twenty-eight .
Okay .
So , you , you were out of s- , you went to school for awhile and quit . Then went back .
Well , no .
I , I went to school and got a degree
and then I worked for awhile .
And then I just started , I started back a year and a half ago .
Changed directions .
Oh , okay .
Yeah .
How old are you ?
Oh , I 'm , uh , twenty-eight .
I was born in sixty-three .
I guess we 're --
Oh , okay .
All right .
-- the same age then .
Yeah .
And , uh , I did n't really start getting into music until I went to college because , uh , my parents did n't really have music in the house .
Put it that way .
Oh , rea- ,
Were they religious ?
Yes .
uh , I see .
I ,
So , I 'm always behind .
I 'm , I 'm not , I 'm never really up to date on all that stuff .
But I know what I like when it 's , uh , when I like a sound . A certain kind of sound ,
yeah .
My parents were very musical .
My mother had --
Uh ,
-- a piano --
Uh-huh .
-- in the , in the house .
My father likes , uh , country western music .
Okay .
He 's from , uh , West Virginia .
So that 's what he grew up listening to .
Uh-huh .
And he 's always liked it
and , and , you know , he 's probably about fifty-three years old now ,
so he grew up like in the late fifties
and --
Huh .
-- you know , when they had that , the Elvis Presley music and stuff like that .
Yeah ,
yeah .
And that kind of rock and roll
so he likes that .
And my mom always liked that kind of stuff .
My mom likes like , uh , Doris Day , you know .
Oh , really .
She always had those , these old Doris Day records and stuff like that , though .
Oh , well .
So , you know , I grew up listening to that stuff .
Yeah .
But , uh , I could see why you went , uh , you know , I could see why you were kind of sheltered --
Yeah .
-- I guess from , from music .
Well , I , I do play the piano , you know .
Oh , okay .
But , uh , I , I like the , uh , early seventies , late sixties rock .
Oh , okay .
Kind of stuff , the old stuff .
And , uh ,
Yeah ,
so do I .
Uh ,
Do you like , uh , like V- , Van Halen or anything like that ?
Or how about Brian Adams ?
Bri- ,
what kind of music is , does what --
It , it ,
-- songs does he play ?
Th- , THIS LOVE CUTS LIKE A KNIFE .
Uh-huh .
Uh , SUMMER OF SIXTY-NINE .
I think I 've heard SUMMER OF SIXTY-NINE .
Yeah .
He sings that .
Yeah .
He 's , he 's from Canada .
Okay .
I 'm not , I 'm not very good at remembering the , uh --
The titles and artists .
-- titles ,
yeah ,
but I can remember this , the song .
Yeah .
Well , do --
Yeah .
-- do you watch music television , M T V at all ? Or V H One ?
No ,
I do n't watch T V much at all .
Okay .
So .
D , do , do you get cable ?
No .
Oh ,
okay .
That 's , that 's --
No .
-- you have to get cable to get those stations anyhow .
Yeah .
So .
But , uh , yeah .
I like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of videos .
Uh-huh .
I like watching that kind of thing .
It 's ,
Do you like , uh , like someone recent ? Like Enya ?
Have you ever head of her .
She 's not rock
but --
No ,
I have n't heard her .
-- she , she 's from Ireland .
Oh , okay .
And , uh , she 's gotten some , uh , she 's been on like the top ten , I guess , or whatever .
Oh , really .
She , she did MUMBLEx ,
Okay .
So how serious is the ,
.
subject of crime in your area ?
Well , needless to say , here in Washington , D C this is the war zone .
Uh , D C around here stands for drug capital or death capital .
.
It 's , uh , it 's really bad here .
Uh , for example , the , uh , local high school , uh , they 've already found two students with sawed off shotguns --
Jeez .
-- and they 're starting to , uh , get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school , of all things .
So ,
Well , luckily , it has n't gotten that bad here .
Uh-huh .
Uh , San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime .
Uh-huh .
Uh , but it 's on the uprise , especially in a lot of the , uh , outlying agricultural towns .
Uh-huh .
Uh , because you end up having a lot of gangs forming , uh , largely around the Hispanic core .
Uh-huh .
Uh , it seems to be that , uh , gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions .
Uh-huh ,
right .
That 's how they , uh , they bind themselves together in groups , I guess
and , uh ,
Yeah .
Now , the ,
interestingly enough , I do n't think we have here , a , a lot of gangs , but , uh , only a couple , uh --
Uh-huh .
-- of , not a whole large group of them , but , uh , just a few . Most of them centered around , uh , drug territory .
Uh-huh .
And so they 're protecting their economic interests , I guess .
Yeah .
And , uh , nowadays the latest thing I 've , I 've read about in the paper here that they 're doing as far as , uh , crimes involving stealing cars is that , instead of stealing , uh , cars like at night , breaking into them or whatever , they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up ,
and then as you get out of the car , they just , uh , step up and , uh , take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house .
Well , that 's efficient .
Yeah ,
that 's the , uh , latest thing .
That way there 's no damage to the car or anything .
They just wait for you to show up after they 've picked out which one they want .
They 're decided they 're completely unworried about being identified or anything --
Uh-huh .
-- of that sort .
Right .
Just wait for you to drive to your house ,
you get out
and they get in ,
.
off they go with your car .
Wow .
So it 's ,
uh , I think they call it car jacking around here .
Yeah ,
yeah ,
I 'd heard that phrase .
Uh-huh ,
yeah ,
that 's kind of the latest thing ,
but , every year in the D C area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides ,
so it 's , uh , it 's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we 're not from around here ,
we 're from , uh , I 'm from Ohio
and my wife 's from Florida
so ,
Uh-huh .
And we 've just come from twenty years in the military and , uh , which is an entirely different environment ,
so this is a whole new thing for , for us to , to have to put up with
and it 's , uh , really scary sometimes .
Yeah ,
there are n't that many ,
.
places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays .
Right .
And it 's pretty bad when they 're using metal detectors in school --
Uh-huh .
-- and , uh , of course , the mayor , uh , of D C is having a real problem , uh , trying to ,
what do you do to , to reduce crime in a , in a major city like D C where it 's a way of life for everybody .
It 's , uh , I would hate to have to wrestle with that problem .
I do n't know what , what the solution is .
Uh , there 's no way they can stop the drugs ,
and that 's what 's causing all the killing .
Well , uh ,
.
there 's a couple of things that I 've heard ,
uh , most of them are fairly , uh , radical in terms --
Uh-huh .
-- of what you 'd have to do .
Uh-huh .
Uh , course the , the reason that , that these kids tend to , to turn toward the drugs and everything else s , seems to be just , you know , the , the , the end results of , of poverty and , and --
Uh-huh .
-- parents that are n't doing any parenting and everything else
because , I mean , you know , the parents are n't making a living at anything .
Right .
Uh ,
And they see all their friends and neighbors , uh ,
And they 're accidental parents half the time anyway .
Yeah ,
and their friends are driving Mercedes
and , so it 's actually ,
they grow up with that as their way of life
and , uh , I think , uh , to a large extent , they do n't understand the concept that what they 're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised .
It 's illegal ,
but it 's not wrong because all their friends do it .
Right
exactly ,
so maybe it 's the law that wrong in their eyes
and they --
Yeah .
-- they say , well , it 's , it 's the law that 's , uh , got to be changed instead of their way of life ,
so , I do n't know ,
it 's ,
I 'm glad it 's not the kind of problem I have to come up with an answer to because it 's not --
Well --
-- easy .
-- I think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of , of an actual solution to the problem . Uh --
Uh-huh .
-- the , the social , the other social problems would n't , would n't go away .
Right .
Uh ,
They 've always been with us .
I mean , there 's , there 's been a lot of , uh ,
and I used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus ,
but then , the --
Uh-huh .
-- more I thought about it , the more sense it made , is that , uh , alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else .
Uh-huh .
Uh , and prohibition did n't stop it and did n't do anything really --
Right .
-- to slow ,
Okay ,
looks like we 're ready to go .
Capital punishment , uh ,
the problem I have with capital punishment is that , uh , uh , it 's supposed to be a deterrent to crime ,
but I do n't think that it really actually does that .
I do n't think it deters anybody , because most of the time crimes are , uh , are committed with a , without any thought to the consequences
and they do n't think that , uh , stop and think and say , well , maybe I should n't do this , uh , because , uh , I might get the gas chamber or something like that .
They worry about it afterwards
and then they try and get out of it .
And , uh , how about you ?
Well , I think that in some cases , it is warranted .
Uh-huh ,
I do , too ,
yep .
And I do n't ,
I think in some cases it does n't matter if it 's a deterrent or not .
Uh-huh ,
yeah ,
you still have to do it .
I ,
I mean --
I ,
-- I mean , I 'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer --
Uh-huh .
-- or ,
So you 're in , you 're in favor of capital punishment , then .
Well , for some things .
Right .
I think for serial murder --
Uh-huh .
-- it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold --
Uh-huh .
-- blood ,
Needs to be punished or , uh , eliminated from society .
I mean ,
.
you ca n't guarantee that they would n't escape --
Right .
-- from prison --
And then do it all over again .
-- and do it again .
Uh-huh .
And I do n't think that , that rehabilitation is effective .
Right .
Have to agree with you ,
and I 'm kind of i- , in favor of capital punishment also .
I just do n't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because , uh , you still see them committing the same crimes ,
but , I tend to agree with you that , uh , we should have it .
I just , I do n't know that it 's always effective ,
but I guess we , uh , we 're kind of stuck with it .
It 's , it 's a difficult , uh , problem , is n't it , to determine how you 're going to punish somebody for a particular crime , uh ,
But , then , you know , I think that , that some murderers do n't really warrant capital punishment .
Uh-huh .
You know ,
.
just , like , for example , uh , you know , you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands --
Uh-huh .
-- who abused them --
Right ,
uh-huh .
-- and I do n't think ,
.
that would really warrant capital punishment .
Uh-huh ,
huh . Do you think they should be punished at all , or , uh , like go to prison , uh ,
because they 're not really a danger to society .
It was almost really self defense , is n't it , in a case like that .
Uh , it is to a certain extent --
Uh-huh .
-- but I think ,
I do n't know because ,
I know they put , uh , put them in jail sometimes , I guess . Uh ,
I think in s- ,
and it ,
.
just would depend upon the circumstances --
Uh-huh .
-- and , and the extent of the abuse --
Uh-huh .
-- and , and if another alternative was --
Um .
-- available .
Uh-huh .
You know , now , I wonder what you think about this
and , uh , unfortunately , we , we do n't get to do it ,
but , uh , it used to be a long time ago , I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment , if somebody did something , for example , to your family , then you had the right to administer the punishment .
So if somebody killed somebody in your family , then you had the right to , uh , if that person was caught and found guilty , you had the right to , uh , execute that person .
And I know that , uh , if somebody had done something to my family , I would feel that I had the right to , to get revenge on them
and , uh , but , I , I do n't think that 's done much anywhere .
That 's kind of drastic punishment .
Well , I think that would be kind of drastic punishment .
Right .
And ,
Might make you feel better
but ,
But , one thing , I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation --
Uh-huh .
-- then that chance sh , should be investigated .
Right .
But , like I said , if , if someone is , is just pathologically --
Uh-huh .
-- going to murder people no matter what --
Right .
-- then I think they should be eliminated from --
Uh-huh .
-- society .
Right ,
because they 're a danger to everybody else .
Huh , that 's interesting .
I have to , uh --
But ,
-- agree with that .
There 's a lot of folks , probably , that are in prison that , uh , that are n't really a danger to society , huh ,
and , uh ,
And a lot of people that are a danger --
Right .
-- to society that are n't in prison .
Right ,
probably more of them then the other way around .
Interesting .
I do n't , I do n't , not sure
I , I 'm in Washington , D C or at least very close to it .
I 'm not sure what kind of , uh , capital punishment we have here .
Well , I know in North Carolina , we do have capital punishment .
Uh-huh .
And I 'm in , I 'm from South Carolina .
Well , we , in , in , in our family , have been pretty remiss in trying to , uh , you know , keep track of , uh , daily finances .
Uh , the , uh , way back , what , twelve years ago or something when I got my first computer , I did what everybody else does , which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks , and , you know , checkbooks and all this kind of thing
and we kept that going for about a month
and it became so onerous that we gave up on it .
Uh-huh .
That sounds about right .
You know , so , uh , the only thing we 're , you know , that we do now is , uh , I keep a , a little spread sheet of , uh , what I call the net worth calculation which is just the , the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth .
Uh , and I only update that , oh I do n't know , maybe once every quarter or so . Every three months . Just , basically when the statements come in .
Uh-huh .
You know . Just to see whether or not we 're falling , you know , getting ahead , falling behind or staying even or what .
Right .
Uh , that 's really about , you know , the extent of , uh , of the kind of , uh , financial score keeping that we 're doing .
Uh .
.
Well it 's kind of difficult for me . Because right now , uh , like most teachers , I 'm laid off
and --
Huh .
Oh dear , that 's terrible .
-- so , um , I spend most , you know ,
I substitute a lot .
Uh-huh .
So it 's a lot , it 's very hard on a nonfixed income because I do n't know how many days I 'm going to be called in and whether I am or not , to try to keep track of finances .
Uh-huh .
And , but I know how much I have to bring in a month .
And that 's about it .
That 's about as far as we go .
And then anything extra is , you know , more or less split up between all of us .
Uh-huh .
And just thrown in the kitty , more or less , for a rainy day .
Oh , I see .
Are you , are you married ?
Are you living with a bunch of , with , with people that you 're sharing expenses ?
Uh , no .
I 'm a single mother .
I have three children .
Oh , I see ,
uh-huh .
So , uh , right now , we 're on , we get f- , you know , aid from the state at this point because there 's no other way to do it .
And my ex-husband just sort of took off and does n't pay child support .
Oh dear .
So right now I know what I 'm getting from the state
and , uh , I have to balance , more or less , what I get from the state with my bills and , uh , you know , try to work as many days as possible .
Uh-huh .
Any time they call me in .
But I still have to figure out .
If I work too many days , then I lose all my state aid
and if I do n't work enough days then I do n't get enough to meet the bills
and it 's like a juggling act every single month .
Uh-huh .
Like this week I 've been just holding my breath and hoping they 'll call me in
but they probably wo n't because next week the kids have school vacation .
I see .
So , you know , the four days before , they only have a four day week --
Uh-huh .
-- and they usually do n't need subs because everybody 's pretty good about coming in .
A- , oh , I see .
They do n't like to be absent before a vacation .
Oh , sure .
But we 're shopping around as far as , well I 'm shopping around as far as trying to get , uh , that 's why I 'm doing this , to get some extra money .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts .
My kids are in Boy Scouts
so trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts
because every penny I bring in is ten percent to me .
So it 's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit .
But , you know , we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul .
I guess we 're in the situation that a lot of am- , middle-class Americans are in .
Uh-huh .
Yeah ,
you 're the first , you know , uh ,
my next door neighbor just lost his job .
Oh , my Lord .
In a , you know , one of these , uh ,
his company went broke . I mean went , you know , bankrupt .
Actually , it was a subsidiary of a , of an outfit called U S Shoe or something .
I- , i- , it was a computer subsidiary .
I do n't know what a shoe company 's doing running a computer company .
Really .
But , uh , you know , they just folded it up and , uh , uh , told him to ,
they took the top management and gave them jobs --
Uh-huh .
-- with the , with the corporate , uh , at the corporate front office
and everybody else was sent packing .
Oh .
Uh , hang on one second
I 've got --
Sure .
-- uh , MUMBLEx somebody was knocking on my door here .
Uh , it sounds like , in a certain sense , at least at the present ,
I mean , it sounds , sounds terrible to say ,
but at the present stage , you probably are even more in the market for a , a budgetary thing than , than most people probably ar , might be .
Right .
In terms of keeping , keeping score of input and output .
Uh-huh .
Definitely .
Do you have , do you have a computer at home
or ,
Uh , yes
we do .
And we try --
Uh-huh .
-- to ,
you know , I keep track of every penny .
Uh-huh .
And , more or less , enter it in .
Every single day I 'm at the computer .
I see .
And , it 's like , okay , what do we have left ,
.
what do we have to pay , what --
Uh-huh .
-- have we paid this month . What has n't come in yet , you know .
Yeah .
Have you , do you use a standard , uh , a standard spread sheet
or I mean ,
Okay ,
this topic is , is Russia a threat to our security ?
I think they are more of a threat to their own people at this day and time .
how do you feel about it ?
.
Well , they do have , uh , a major internal problem .
Everybody wants to defect ,
and I can understand why .
Um , I think their biggest problem is just , you know , obtaining food to live ,
so when you have the basic needs , uh ,
.
being unmet , I do n't think you think globally as far as , you know , being a threat to other people in the world .
.
So , as soon as they get their , their own home country taken care of , then they 'll consider ,
.
what they can do with the rest of the world .
I believe Communism is very much waning .
It 's , uh , pretty much on the way out of the door , insofar as the strong hold that they used to have ,
and the Russian people are all realizing that the Communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world ,
and their rebellions right now is the result of that .
If they can get the army ,
.
or the military to sway to their side , I think that , uh , it will be on the way out eventually .
It 's just a matter of time , because ,
.
in the Baltic States they have already massacred so many people who protested ,
.
and that has n't set too well with their diplomacy for the , regarding the , uh , outcome of their affairs .
What 's your synopsis ? .
Well , I do , I do realize that , uh , uh , the Bush Administration is n't too happy with , with how they 're handling their internal , uh , strife , you know , as far as diplomacy is concerned .
I think it 's been a good , a good positive direction for uh , the Soviets as far as Yeltsin is concerned .
You know , he was , uh , allowed to ,
what , wh ,
in his , in the Congress they , they gave him more power as far as his republic in Russia is concerned , which is , gives him more power overall , which I think is a good sign that there will be some , you know ,
politically speaking , you know , he 's going to have more power ,
, and I think it 's a step in the right direction .
I think Gorbachev realizes that he 's got a , a major uh , uh , power figure , you know , competing against him ,
and I think it 's going to be pretty close to his demise if he does n't follow suit with Yeltsin as far as , uh , realizing ,
well , he does realize it , you know , with the fact that they reduced the uh , or they , increased the prices on their food , food and goods .
Uh-huh .
Uh .
I think that it went up a thousand percent on most ,
It ,
yeah .
Tha- , that 's incredible
but they had to , uh , go in the direction of a market driven economy ,
and , and they had to bite the bullet for that .
So that 's a good move , on , on Gorbachev 's part in doing that .
Uh-huh .
So ,
but Gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that ,
.
he 's moving towards a two to three party system of government that , nor eliminating or diminishing the Communist power ,
and I guess that 's where Yeltsin steps in , so far as his politics of government goes , uh ,
but I do n't know how convinced the people are of him yet , myself .
Well , that 's all they got right now .
That 's their ray of hope .
Uh-huh .
So , you know , they 'll go with ,
.
you know , whoever comes through for them .
I , it , it 's just that ,
.
the weird thing is , is that Gorbachev is the one that opened the floodgates , as far as with glasnost and poistro- , perestroika and stuff ,
and I think he 's got between the Old Guard and , , and the new , uh , glasnost .
Uh , I think it 's kind of escalated to a point where it 's out of control .
Uh-huh .
And I think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how , in order to keep the peace on , peace on both sides .
So I think that 's where you know , , kind of where he 's stuck .
You know what I 'm saying ?
Yeah .
Uh , I understand .
And that 's the , that 's the situation that he finds himself in ,
and you know , he 's a tough guy ,
I mean , he 's been through it .
So I have no doubt that he 'll ,
I mean , I , I think overall he 's been a , a , good figure for the Soviet Union .
I mean , I think his intentions and his ideals are , are uh , well intentioned .
Uh-huh .
And in the long-term ,
but I just think that because of the basic needs that the people do n't have ,
I think that , uh , makes the problem most severe , and makes him look , look worse that what his , um , what his ideals are ,
.
personally .
I agree .
What 's bad for the Soviet system is that , they have the resources to grow and produce their food ,
but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should .
I think it 's , I think it 's a lot of , uh , oh , how do you put it ? , bureaucracy and , and , uh , one thing , and then all the corruption .
I think there 's a , a large amount of corruption on the , the have and the have-nots .
Yeah .
That 's probably more true than ,
You know ,
I --
a lot of people realize .
-- I know you 're going to have that with every society .
At least we 're more blatant about it ,
but it 's very secret ,
and it 's been going on for years .
I mean , you ca n't change things overnight .
Uh-huh .
And , but if it gets to a point where people ca n't , survive , I mean , there 's revolution . You know ,
and that 's ,
It seems to be headed in that direction too .
Yeah ,
big time ,
major ,
but you know , that 's , that 's what happens when , you know , the cork blows
and you ca n't handle it anymore .
I mean , that 's --
Uh-huh .
-- that 's the way the world , uh , you know , revolves that way .
Anyway ,
Well , their knowledge , with , uh , better communication processes in this world now that 's reached them is more educated than to the , uh , ways of the western world ,
and uh , I think that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways of changing things , too .
I really question , though , how much technology the average Soviet is exposed to .
They ,
probably not enough ,
but I 'm sure I lot of it 's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind , of what they 're missing out on .
Yeah ,
I think they 're starting to realize ,
but I , I just do n't think they have the resources , if you were to compare , uh , the Americans to the Soviets as far as home computers are concerned or fact machines , Fax machines and cellular phones , and state of the art equipment that we are so used to .
I do n't think they even realize what 's out there , and to what extent .
Yeah ,
I 'm sure a lot of them are missing those household items .
Yeah ,
the major conveniences of life .
Yeah
what we consider just , I do n't , normal everyday things to them is real luxury .
Yeah .
Which is unfortunate for them ,
and of course , most of us , we do n't really appreciate what we 've got because we 've been so used to it .
This is true .
This is very true .
And we ,
it 's human , it 's human nature though to take things for granted
and it kind of ,
.
you know ,
when you 've lost something or , or uh , uh , do n't have what other people have that 's when you tend to realize , you know , what 's out there and what , you know , what you have and what you do n't have .
Yeah
I agree .
So the original question , do we think they 're a threat to our , you know , a security threat ?
Yeah .
Um , yes and no .
Yeah ,
I can go with that answer too .
The only yes I could go to is if uh , a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to , to a nuclear exchange ,
but I do n't even see that occurring .
Um , no .
Uh , because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be adapted to I guess .
Well , I do n't really feel that the Soviets really want to blow up the world .
I mean , um , we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as , as nonfeeling machine type people ,
and they 're people just like us .
I mean --
Uh-huh .
-- you know , they get up everyday ,
and they put their pants on the same way ,
and they have to eat and everything else ,
and I just do n't feel that ...
Okay .
Well why do n't you start cause it said I was suppose to ask you what do you ,
Do you have any elderly relatives currently in an , uh , nursing home now ?
Yes ,
I do .
Do you ?
I have a grandmother .
She 's a hundred and two .
Oh my gosh .
She 'll be a hundred and three in August .
Uh-huh .
And we decide not to put her in a nursing home .
She lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town
and then my sister takes care of her .
Uh-huh .
She , even though she is a hundred and two , she still has all of her faculties .
Right .
She still has her snap .
She takes care of her own business .
This is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker ,
but with somebody that needs around the clock care ,
I have seen my family age .
Right .
I have seen them in the ,
she 's been there ten years now .
And I have seen them age twenty --
Yeah .
-- in the time and , and with the expense and everything ,
I th , I still think it is worth it if you , if you had a good nursing home
and they needed some quality care ,
I would --
Right .
-- put someone in a nursing home .
My mother-in-law finally .
They had to make a family decision .
There 's seven children in my husband 's family
and fortunately four of them live in the same home town
and she has Alzheimer 's .
It was getting where she was getting th- , dangerous . I mean --
Uh-huh .
-- letting strangers in and things like this ,
but they were very fortunate .
It 's a small town
and she happens to room with one of the doctor 's mothers
and --
Oh , well that 's good .
-- then she 's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time
but she really does n't .
Nobody thought she would adjust ,
but she has adjusted beautifully .
Oh , that is great .
But then I am also facing my father who is very sick
and my mother and father reside in Colorado .
She 's been taking care of him .
I do n't know how much longer this can last
and at that point because he requires round the clock .
He ca n't do anything without her .
He does n't know when to take his medicine
and it 's really sad
and I have thought if something would happen to my mother for , uh ,
my brothers are not interested in helping me
so I would have to move him down here .
That way ,
I want to see the nursing home . If I have to put him into one .
You know , where I can go see it .
I , I 'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado .
And ,
Oh , why yeah .
I am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas .
Yes .
And some of them are limited care too where people can do , uh ,
like they have apartment styles ,
but that would n't work for him .
I think he is beyond that .
Where if you need help you can get it ,
but basically people kind of have a small apartment
and doctors are available if they need them .
Uh-huh .
I , I --
And allows ,
-- know a lady that lives in a place similar --
Yeah .
-- to that in Austin .
Yeah .
Well , the only problem with these are that they are very expensive .
Of course , I guess all nursing homes there is
but ,
And the bad thing about it , before you can get any kind of government help , you just practically have , well you have to be a pauper .
Right .
It , it takes every penny .
They want you to spend every dime you have --
Yeah .
-- before the government will pay for your your care .
Right .
And that 's the sad part about it .
Yeah .
I , uh ,
yeah ,
and I think a lot of people who do it now .
In Colorado it 's interesting .
I talked to my mother .
They allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home .
And my mother could make it on that .
What she probably would do is disburse the money to me
and then I would send it back to her
so that 's what would happen .
Uh-huh .
I think that 's what most people do .
You just have to give it , everything away .
Yeah .
It 's unfortunate .
I , I work at a brokerage firm
and I have seen so many people that just have to gift , you know , their belongings --
Right .
-- as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home .
Yeah .
It 's frightening .
And I guess , uh , I do n't know how old you are .
I 'm forty-six .
You know , we 're the generation moving into this
and I do n't know how our kids are going to take care of us .
I ca n't imagine .
You know .
I 'm twenty-nine .
Yeah .
And everybody in my family has always had ,
we do n't have any children .
Everybody that has , has them later in life .
Yeah .
So , my , my mother and my father are in their late sixties .
So , I mean , they 're not --
Right .
-- that far away .
I also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise
and he 's still living at home
and I do n't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are .
Oh , I know .
And so , it 's kind of ,
you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations ,
but it , something will have to change as more and more of us get older .
Uh , luckily , if we could be like your grandmother , I , uh you know , I would love to live to a hundred and two if I were okay .
But --
It ,
but yeah .
-- you see these people in their seventies --
Most people are n't .
-- yeah ,
most are n't .
That 's the problem .
And that 's the bad thing .
I would hate to have lived so long .
She lived by herself .
My grandfather passed away before I was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety , ninety-one .
That 's incredible .
And just did everything ,
Hello Ann .
Hello Chuck .
Uh , the other day , I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling --
Uh-huh .
-- and , uh , I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places --
Uh-huh .
-- and , uh , they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste .
Uh , I did n't think that was a new revelation .
Well , it 's not too new .
Right .
So , what what is the E P A recommending now ?
Oh , they really did n't propose any solutions .
Actually , they were , the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A .
Uh-huh .
But , he had a lot of , uh , facts to , to give and , uh , things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down
and , and , uh , one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of , of news print .
He was talking about , uh , the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print --
Yeah .
-- and they could sell it for a while .
They were able to sell it for some amount per ton
and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling , they 've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away .
Right .
That 's a , that 's a common problem though .
That it seems , that has happened in Dallas as well as New York
and I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house
and after a while I just quit taking the newspaper because I could n't recycle it anymore which is n't good for business on the other end either , I suppose .
Yeah .
We 're doing some here in , in Cash Valley , the community here .
Uh-huh .
There 's , uh , we 've actually got a kind of a nice set up .
We 've got a couple of plants here that actually take , uh , recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it 's not a fire hazard --
Right .
-- and make it into insulation
and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them . Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside .
Well , that 's good .
So one of the real keys , it sounds like , to getting recycling for , uh , paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it .
Right .
There has to be , uh , a reuse for it .
I mean , that 's why they recycle .
The one I think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that , uh , the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers . Uh , everything from , uh , waste baskets to carpet to the no stick , I mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet --
Uh-huh .
-- and , uh , I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days
and they 're making clothes now that are recycled .
Like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that .
And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama
and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government .
One was like , environmental protection
and the other one was , oh , I ca n't remember what ,
but the basic idea , it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill --
Uh-huh .
-- and , uh , the solution that he came up with for plastics , and it was really quite amazing ,
he says , well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them .
Oh really .
He came to the conclusion , plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it 's , it 's low weight , but it 's high volume so it takes up a lot of space --
Right .
-- and there 's almost no energy , there 's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling ,
but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it , produce electricity .
Huh .
So his solution was to burn plastic . Collect it and burn it .
Well , it 's carbon
so that makes sense ,
like a carbon fuel of some sort ,
but --
Yeah .
-- what --
And it 's more than even paper or something like that .
There is more energy in it per pound or whatever .
-- what about emissions ?
Well that was he did n't deal with that .
Oh .
He just said burn it .
Okay .
He did n't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that .
So it 's not very practical MUMBLEx .
No .
Well it 's interesting .
I bet that was a good day , at the yeah , conference then .
Yeah ,
well , real interesting .
Did it change anything for you ?
Uh , not too much .
Uh , I got a bit .
Actually ,
So , uh , you know , my feeling is that , uh , it 's really being used today ,
it , it , you know , it , it really is n't doing any real good purpose for anything because it 's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal .
Right ,
I think I 've seen some statistics that say that , uh , it 's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life .
Right
because y- , you , you 've got all , all the prison expenses , plus all the legal expenses .
Right .
Uh , and , you know , it certainly does n't seem to be a deterrent . Uh , for one thing because it 's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly do n't think the people that are committing the c- , crimes that would be eligible , you know , really care .
Well , that 's ,
committing them mostly is , you know , either crimes of passion or at the moment
or they think they 're not going to get caught
or ,
Right ,
I mean , it 's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon , you know ,
I 'm invulnerable ,
I do n't need to care about this .
You know , I , I , I 'm --
Yeah ,
b- ,
-- never going to get caught .
Yeah ,
but you also have to think whether it 's worthwhile on the individual basis , for example , someone like , uh , Jeffrey Dahlmer ,
do you want ,
by putting him in prison for life , there is still a possibility that he will get out again .
Yeah ,
one , one --
Whereas --
-- way or another .
-- if you kill him , there is not that possibility .
Yeah ,
but , but the other side to that is , if you put him in prison for life , there 's a chance that he might do things in prison , or , you know , and somehow redeem himself .
Yeah ,
I do n't think he could ever redeem himself ,
but --
Well ,
-- in some cases , yes .
You know , so that , you know ,
the , the question is , you know , the other qu- , problem with capital punishment you run into is , what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent , you know ?
There are cases where , you know , twenty , thirty years after the fact of getting evidence , especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence , then , oops ,
I 'm sorry ,
guess we killed the wrong guy .
Yeah ,
it 's , it 's ,
yeah ,
once you 've made a decision that way , it 's a little difficult to go back on it .
Right ,
you , you can apologize nicely ,
but , you know , you know , I think , you know , the , the price , you know ,
it , I 've heard quotes , you know , it 's better that a thousand people go free , than one person be unjustly imprisoned . I think i , is really the , the philosophy of the way our legal system works .
Oh , yeah ,
yeah ,
it 's a- ,
the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is , uh , based on the , uh , person who is accused .
Yeah ,
and , you know , the , I , I think that , you know ,
and the way it 's being used now , it 's like you listen to Bush is , you know ,
well , where are we going to impose d- , you know ,
it 's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in ,
Tsongas is also saying , you know , capital , make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer .
Right .
And , again , I do n't thing these people care .
They risk their lives every day .
Yeah ,
and , there , there , they seem that the profit marg- , uh , drug dealers , the profit margin 's so high that , yeah --
Yeah .
-- the , the risk is almost not there .
Yeah ,
and , and , you know , uh , especially , now , I live in , in Massachusetts , you know ,
w- , w- , we 're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something .
Yeah .
So , you know ,
but you look at our , our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to , to like Texas or someplace that does , you know , it , it , it 's impossible to make a case that it 's , it 's affecting it in any way .
Yeah .
I think it 's mainly , people , like , they get the vengeance of it .
Yeah ,
well --
Because , you know ,
-- it 's also ,
I used to live in Georgia
and , you know , the , the big thing down there was , all right , we have capital punishment ,
but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed , it 's very racially related --
Oh , yeah --
-- and ethnically related ,
-- it 's mainl- , lot of blacks .
Also a lot of young people .
You know , a , a , a sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what I 've seen .
Right .
And , you know , I , I think when you listen to like the , uh , the , the victims ' families and things , they 're always talking about , you know , uh , feeling justified or feeling , you know , like they 've gotten something out of it ,
I mean , my thought has been , once the guy has been imprisoned , if he goes to jail forever or whatever , if he gets killed , it should n't make any difference to the , uh , the victim 's family .
The only thing that should really , I mean ,
obviously , if someone of mine who has close died , I 'd probably feel differently ,
but --
Right .
-- you know , th- , you know , what , the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society .
Right
and that ,
and , you know , also by keeping them in prison , you do have the possibility , though , we do n't currently do this , of making restitution .
Right ,
I mean , the ,
You , you will work your prison job
and any money you earn will go to the victim 's family .
Right
and , the , the other thing is that , you know , I was reading through a book on , uh , geneo , human geneo research --
Uh-huh .
-- and there , more and more things like schizophrenia
and why , does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin .
Right .
So if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say , well , the problem is you , you 've got an endorphin imbalance
and , you know , if you take this regularly , you 'll be a sane and productive member of society --
Uh-huh .
-- you know ,
you really get back to the question of , you know , is someone responsible for their actions .
Yeah ,
well , I , I think on some of it , you have to say someone 's responsible for his actions .
I never like the , uh , --
Society made me do it .
-- the defense ,
Yeah .
Well , I never liked the , uh , insanity defense .
Well , anyway I , uh , I , uh , oh ,
yeah .
I did forget to ask you .
What is your name by the way ?
Uh , I 'm Ann .
Oh , you 're Ann .
Hi .
But , uh , anyway , I , uh ,
lot of , lot of interesting procedural things I think would be a good , be a good change if we 're going to be talking about the subject t- , tonight which in some I guess criminal courts the ,
Criminal courts ?
Yes .
Yeah .
Th- , the one of which was , uh , something , something that 's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town
and that is , uh , and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race . Uh ,
Oh , really ?
Yeah .
Well , they , they , uh , the , the people that MUMBLEx
the , uh , the jury that 's trying , uh , the officers in that case ,
Uh-huh .
is , is an all white panel .
And there 's been a lot made in the local papers of that ,
I see .
fact .
I ca n't ,
I 'm a little surprised they did n't get a change of venue on that one .
They have .
They have .
They moved it up to the county north of here .
Oh .
Um , it 's in Ventura
and there 's , there 's still quite a bit of publicity obviously ,
and it 's kind of , it 's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that , uh , that ,
Well , that videotape was just horrible .
Yeah .
It was everywhere .
Yes .
So you know ,
and I , I think it would be very difficult to find someone , uh , find a panel that would be , not have seen it and , and known of what was going on .
Oh , I agree with you
but I ca n't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of , of discrimination or , or , you know , uh , appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff .
Exactly .
You know , um , the you know ,
I , I 'm kind of torn on this issue .
It 's like they 're saying well on the one hand they 're not , he 's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways I think true .
But on the other hand , it 's , it 's also saying that white jurors are not going to , are not going to convict .
Right .
Uh , you know , they 're not going to do their job . Which is
the whole , the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or , or , or , uh , let go based on whether ,
Exactly .
or not the person , whether or not the evidence says ,
Based on fact .
Right .
that there 's enough ,
How interesting .
Oh .
So what 's the prevailing thought within the community ?
Um ,
I mean you know , what the news media is going to make of it ,
but what about the community ?
They , well ,
I guess it depends on who you talk to .
I have n't talked to , uh , I have n't talked to a whole lot of black people on it
but I , I rather imagine there 's , there 's some snickering about it . And a lot of the usually fatalistic , uh , here we go again folks ,
Uh-huh .
kind of stuff .
Oh , my goodness .
That ca n't be good for Los Angeles either .
No ,
no .
I , you know ,
on , on , on one hand you know , on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it 's sm- , they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing ,
Oh , exactly .
these people beating the heck out of this guy . Um ,
Unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to a big city like Los Angeles .
You 're going to have it just about anywhere .
Uh-huh .
There .
Well ,
But that 's , that 's interesting .
Yeah . Um ,
What about the judge who 's hearing the case ?
Is he going to be impartial ?
Is he going to ,
.
be a go , a good adjudicator ?
I do n't know . You know ,
and , and again there 's something else tha , you know , there was a , uh , something else along those lines .
There was a girl out here named Latausha Harlins .
I do n't know if it 's , it 's got , it 's got as much notoriety
but it 's rather almost as infamous here as it was , as it was with , uh , the Rodney King problem .
Um , a girl walked into a Korean owned store
and , uh , they , she had a dispute , black girl .
Uh-huh .
She , she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the , with the owner of the store .
The owner of the store popped her .
Oh , really ?
Yeah .
And , and , oh , of course , they ,
you know , the criminal case went up
and , and the judge gave the woman who shot her , shot the girl a , uh , uh , practically a suspended sentence .
I mean it was --
Oh , my goodness .
-- it was just ,
she gave her no time in jail , you know , all of these things
and then , oh , there 's we have these , we have people wondering around to- , with petitions trying to get the judge ,
To get that judge recalled I would think .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Huh .
That 's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences .
Yeah .
It would make , it would make life easier .
It would .
Yeah .
Uh ,
But ,
you would know , the whole world would know what you were facing .
And then it 's a matter of , of deciding ,
.
Okay .
Uh , before a couple of years ago , I had a , a very narrow view of , of nursing homes
and it was , uh , more like a funeral home .
I always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home .
And , uh , then I had to do some volunteer work here in Tyler , Texas
and I went to one
and it just had a very good activities director .
Everyone was cheerful
and now I do n't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore .
But I , I certainly would n't want to send my parent unless it was an absolute last re- , resort .
Uh , I have a sister that is in nursing school
and she 's real interested in geriatrics .
Well , that sounds good .
Yeah .
So , uh , she , she 's real interested in , uh , what Ann Richards has been doing .
She 's , Ann Richards is really cracking down on , uh , the nursing homes
and , I do n't know , you would n't know anything about a Texas governor .
I 've heard the name
and that 's about all it goes .
Okay .
Ann Richards is our governor in Texas
and she 's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes .
And , uh , my sister 's real interested in that and , and getting into the , to that side of nursing .
Yeah .
That 's one problem with the , the nursing home environment .
It , the elderly , even out of the nursing home , are very open to abuse .
Right .
Uh , you know , they do n't always have their full wits about them .
Uh-huh .
They 're not completely up on what should be going on or what 's not going on .
Uh-huh .
And it can be pretty sad .
I 've got a , had a grandmother who had a stroke .
And she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died .
Oh .
And , you know , it 's the type of thing that she was living down in Florida .
My in- , families was up in Maryland --
Uh-huh .
-- and the other part of her family was up in , uh , New York state .
Right .
And , you know , it was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she was , uh , you know , could not do very much for herself after the stroke .
Right .
And , you know , the nursing home was the , you know , best facility to put her in .
Uh-huh .
You know , besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work
and both my , uh , aunts and uncle work .
Right .
Which means it 's , you know , very difficult for some- ,
you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full-time .
Right .
And , you know , there 's also a lot of medical problems that ca n't always be completely handled in the home .
Right .
Which makes it , you know ,
it 's a necessary evil I think .
Uh-huh .
It sure is .
And some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive . Because --
Yeah .
-- cause they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older .
Yeah .
And , you know , even there you have to watch out for , you know ,
you get one person who 's a little bit dishonest working in there
and , you know , the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry --
Oh , yeah .
-- and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes .
Right .
My grandfather passed away several years ago .
I was much younger .
But , uh , he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life
and someone visited him every day .
My grandmother did .
But , uh , if she could n't , someone visited him every day .
It was in a very small town nursing home .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , people did n't get paid much there at all .
They did n't care about what went on .
Yeah .
They would let a , let a patient get a lot of bed sores .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , the , the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that would n't get met because they were just old people .
And then , the nurses and doctors really did n't put any for , forth any loving care for them .
Either that or they 're just so understaffed that they ca n't afford --
Right .
-- to put in the , uh , care that they need .
Right .
Cause it 's , you know ,
an elderly person can , you know ,
it 's like a newborn baby .
You need --
Uh-huh .
-- to have twenty-four hour care --
Right .
-- uh , answering all the needs cause they ca n't do much for themselves at certain points .
Right .
And nurses get so worn down .
Uh-huh .
And , you know , there 's a lot of , number of
the elderly are very , you know , complaining because they remember the way that things used to be .
Right .
And remember being able to do things for themselves which , you know , they no longer can .
Oh , sure .
And they feel --
And it , very , very hard for them to accept that .
-- they feel pretty helpless .
We just , uh , moved my grandfather into , not a nursing home but , you know , a transitional type facility .
Is it , uh , like a retirement center ?
More of a retirement home .
He 's got his own efficiency apartment .
Uh-huh .
And they provide one meal a day .
Uh-huh .
And , you know , the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him .
Uh-huh .
But they do have , you know , group activities going on .
How 's he handling that ?
Uh , he 'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in Florida .
Uh-huh .
Uh , you know , to move into that facility we moved him from Florida up to Maryland
and --
Ooh .
-- it 's , it 's a bit of a shock to the system , weather-wise , if nothing else .
Oh , sure .
There was n't anything like that , that you could do in Florida ?
Well there was stuff like that in Florida
but ,
Uh , so , uh , what are your benefits like at your job ,
and how do you feel about them ?
Uh , pretty good , actually .
I work for Hewlett Packard
and they have , uh , a pretty good , uh , benefits package .
In fact , they 're , they 're kind of known , uh , for having good benefits .
The pay is n't fabulous ,
although I saw a survey recently
and I 'm actually making just about as much as , you know , I 'm m- , making actually over average , over the average --
Oh , that 's good .
-- for my career , my experience and all that stuff --
Uh-huh .
-- which kind of surprised me .
What kind of a degree have you got ?
I 've got a Bachelor 's in electrical engineering
so ,
Oh .
And I 'm not , like , a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff .
Uh-huh .
Uh , anyway , the , our benefits are pretty good .
We 've got stock purchase program and a ,
that , that 's pretty generous , although you have to hold the stock for two years --
Uh-huh .
-- before you get the company contribution which is , kind of a , a pain ,
but , uh , there 's a four O one K plan --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , for , uh , sheltering some taxable income .
Uh-huh .
Uh , there 's ,
How long have you been with them ?
I 've been with them for seven years .
Uh .
Yeah .
That 's good .
And , the best thing , and a lot of the stuff , the best thing is like four years or five years , it 's pretty soon , you 're --
Uh-huh .
-- completely vested in the retirement plan and everything ,
so , uh , it 's not t- ,
but there 's full , uh , th- , there 's several medical plans to choose from , uh , that cover pretty much everything .
I do n't get sick that often ,
so I do n't pay much of it ,
b- , and I pay five dollars every time I visit the , the hospital --
Uh-huh .
-- that , you know , for a checkup or whatever .
Uh-huh .
Uh , they do n't cover eyes though ,
and I , I have contact lenses ,
so that 's kind of a pain .
Uh-huh .
But , you know , I --
But , for all --
-- I can live ,
-- practical purpose , you are almost a hundred percent covered .
Oh , yeah ,
yeah .
So that you 've got small , small things to gripe about .
Right .
Wow .
And ,
Well , that sounds like you must feel really good about it .
Yeah ,
yeah ,
and , and the dental plan is fabulous .
The dental plan , I pay absolutely nothing because , uh --
Wow .
-- I , I guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that --
Uh-huh .
-- but --
Uh-huh .
-- that 's not the case ,
so , I guess nothing .
It 's fabulous .
Wow .
Uh , the ,
what about you ?
Well , I , uh , work in Washington at the Naval Research Laboratory .
I also have a part time job at a law firm
and I get no benefits from them , at to the part time work although , they pay better per hour --
Uh-huh .
-- than my , my sort of , quote , real job does .
.
Uh , and benefits , through the government are , uh , really ,
uh , they just , uh , they 're not the greatest .
Uh , I , before I , I , uh , uh , got my degree --
Uh ,
-- I 'm , uh , c- , a computer scientist --
Uh-huh .
-- and before I got my degree , I had , uh , done paralegal work --
Uh-huh .
-- for law firms here in Washington
and , uh , at that time , I was in gravy city .
Uh , the law firms in this town are not , you know ,
for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the --
Yeah .
-- early eighties
and , uh , benefits were just amazing --
Uh-huh .
-- and we had everything paid for ,
and , uh , anyway , with the government , it 's not , uh , quite that nice a deal .
Uh , but it 's , you know , it 's , it 's okay .
What we have to do is , we have to pay , uh , about twenty percent of our , uh , uh , our costs
and it 's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing ,
and the plans that are available to us , uh , range from kind of mediocre to really sweet
and , uh , so I , I think I 'm actually involved in a relatively good p- , plan at this point .
Uh , but , uh , it could be better ,
that 's for sure ,
and , uh , but , you know --
Yeah .
-- the- , there are other things that you get when you work for the government i- , uh , in , in terms of , uh , more relaxed atmosphere .
It 's really nice to be , for me , anyway , to be able to work in , uh , a research atmosphere , uh , where I do n't have to , uh , uh , you know , worry about , uh , academics or anything like that ,
and , so I 'm , I 'm really kind of happy about that end of , of things .
It 's , uh ,
Yeah ,
one of the things with my company is that they 've , uh , got a reputation for a lot of job security
and , uh --
Uh-huh .
-- there 's a lot of different things that they do , lot of different divisions even this area , in the San Francisco Bay Area that they do ,
so there 's ,
I , myself have moved around quite a bit within the company --
Uh-huh .
-- and it 's , and I , and I have n't had to move my residence to do that .
You know , I still live in San Jose
and ,
Wow ,
that 's fabulous .
Yeah
it ,
You see , now that 's , that 's interesting ,
because I have a cousin whose husband works for Hewlett Packard --
Oh , yeah ?
-- up in the Massachusetts area .
Yeah .
He , he lives in Andover --
Uh-huh .
-- and , uh , the work that he ,
he 's , uh , specifically an engineer and , and does work with , uh , the Hewlett Packard machines that do , uh , uh , sonographic imagining --
Right ,
right .
-- and , uh , I 've been over to see his complex over there
and it 's amazing .
Uh-huh .
It 's , it 's all ecologically designed
and , and , uh , he seems really , really happy with the , the set up .
Yeah ,
yeah .
And ,
In fact , I know a guy who works at Andover who used to work , who I used to work with out here --
Uh-huh .
-- and he moved his family back east a few years ago to , to take that position .
Kind of interesting .
Uh , a- , anyhow ,
Steve , uh , with the election year and whatnot coming up , do you think we ought to cut taxes , raise them ,
or , or , or what do you think ?
Well , that 's , that 's a really hard question .
I do know that , uh , politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths .
Uh , I
let 's example , uh ,
our friend , the President , right now , says no new taxes ,
we should and especially , if anything , be cutting taxes now because of the recession
and at the same time , the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases ,
so , uh , I know the politicians , uh , are n't , are n't straightforward .
Now , i- , in terms of economics I 'm not ,
it 's hard , hard to call .
It really is .
Uh-huh .
See , I never thought really , it 's , uh , I never really thought that , that the , the question really had to do whether or not we 're paying too much or too little .
I , I always that the , the real question was is , are we getting a reasonable return on , on investment .
For instance , like Social Security tax or Soc- , uh ,
I mean , that 's , that 's tax
we 're paying money
and , and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire , the money will be there for us .
Right .
So that 's ,
yeah , you know ,
when I , when I see that money taken out of my paycheck each , each week , I , or each , every other week , I , I really think that money 's history
and --
Yes , uh ,
-- you know , so as far as return investment , that 's not , that 's nothing
and we 're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back .
Uh , someone was telling me that there is a , uh , uh , there 's still an office in , uh , you know , staffed with , with people there and , in D C that are researching to find a cure for polio , which ,
I may be wrong ,
but I believe that the cure for polio is already founded ,
but , but supposedly once you have an office in D C , or , you know , and , and staff it with people , it 's really tough to close it down
and , and they just have n't yet .
Well , yeah ,
I 'm not exactly sure , uh , about polio in particular .
I know we have a polio vaccine come will prevent somebody from getting polio --
Uh-huh .
-- I 'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio .
Well , that might be the difference .
I do n't know .
Uh , the other thing that , uh , I remember seeing on T V lately is , uh , had to do with ,
it 's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically --
Right .
-- that , that histor , for some reason , historical sites with , you know , the , the full federal money and everything seem to appear as , as almost as like political favors to , to very strong politicians .
Yeah ,
it 's , it 's , it 's funny because , uh , it was one of the things that Bush is trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where , uh , you know , Congress is able to attach all kinds of , uh , funny amendments for individual , uh , c , congressional districts --
Uh-huh .
-- to the , to the main budget proposals
and the poor President has , has to , uh , either accept or reject the whole thing .
So , it sounds like you , uh , you think that , that we 'd be able to save some money by , uh --
Oh .
-- passing the line item veto .
I , I think the line item veto is not , not , is not necessarily a bad thing , assuming that the , uh , the , the President , uh , uses it to get rid of , uh , this kind of waste .
On the other hand , uh , it , it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things .
Yeah .
Uh , and just to get rid of the unimportant things .
And whenever there 's that kind of subjective judgment , there 's always going to be a dispute --
Uh-huh .
-- as to , uh , where the exa- , where the boundary between waste and , and necessity is .
So I 'm not , I 'm not sure that , that that will help solve our problems ,
but there definitely is , is a problem with ,
uh , I forgot ,
there 's a political term for this stuff , pork barrel or something .
Yeah .
Uh ,
Pork barrel politics .
Pork barrel politics .
The- , the- , there has to be some way to do it .
I know state governors usually have line item vetos
and , uh , I lived in Massachusetts for a while
and , uh , when Dukakis vetoed certain things , there was a big uproar and was n't necessarily so popular .
Yeah ,
but Massachusetts was n't , when Dukakis was there , anyway , was n't in that great shape financially .
D- ,
at least at the end .
Uh-huh .
I mean , I do n't know ,
I ,
Yeah ,
i- , i- , they were very good at first ,
they were in very good financials at first
and , uh , that 's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well .
And then , of course , the bottom fell out .
It 's , uh , I mean , it 's , it 's tough .
I mean , there 's , there 's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations .
I guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot
or you can hope that if people keep their money that they 'll spend more and create jobs and , and whatnot .
And spare the economy .
Yeah ,
it 's really , it 's a hard balance . It , it definitely is .
Even not for government , even just , say , for a small business .
Uh , I know some ,
Uh , well , I 'm not sure how it is in Georgia ,
but in , in Pittsburgh the r- , the crime rate really is not very high at the moment .
Is that , is that true for , for Atlanta ?
Atlanta is kind of high .
Uh , it 's , it 's lower than it has been in the past .
Uh , I guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off ,
and usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher .
Yeah ,
I ,
that 's probably not true only for Atlanta , but for just about anywhere .
Yeah .
Uh , what kind of crime problem do you usually run into ?
Any specifics ?
Well , uh , the least , what , from what 's on the news , uh , there are very few , like actual robberies reported , uh , uh , of , of residences .
What 's more likely to occur is , uh , robbery of , uh , you know , knocking over a , a small store or a car theft , you know , it , things of that nature .
Very few , uh , assaults ,
although on the college campuses , uh , there are , uh , cases of , you know , like people getting machine from a , from an automated teller and , you know , somebody trying to , to device a scam for , for , uh , getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners .
Um .
But mostly petty things and , n- , no , nothing , nothing really too big .
Right ,
well , I guess here we run into that sometime ,
but I guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins --
Right .
-- that type , not much home break ins .
There are some , but not , not very high .
Uh , as far as tellers and things like that , it 's not extremely high either .
There were one case where , uh , this one guy , uh , was taking women from the teller and , and , you know , making them give him money and stuff and --
Uh-huh .
-- then at the same time , raping them all ,
so , so that 's kind of like a double assault there .
Yeah ,
uh , a strange case that , uh , that happened , oh , it 's about , about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine .
Really ?
It was a free standing machine
and they backed up into it with a truck --
Uh-huh .
-- and put it on the back and drove away with it .
Oh , wow .
Now , there 's a crime for you .
Yeah ,
there 's a crime .
Yeah ,
but , uh , I guess most of the things that happen around here are , are pretty , uh , innocuous .
Although , uh , from what I hear in the news ,
and , and I , I s , saw an episode of the T V show , COPS --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , one time that was in Pittsburgh ,
and , uh , it , it , it did surprise me , because , you know , they were doing drug arrests and thing , and things like that ,
but I , I do n't really think those things happen too often because , like I said , from what 's reported in the news , at least , it 's , it 's not all that common .
Oh , okay .
I do n't know ,
crime situations here , they ,
like I say , lot of , lot of cases is usually just apartments and , and break ins and things like that
and a lot of it is due to drugs .
Yeah .
Uh , drug related , you know , in , in most cases ,
it 's not like , uh , it 's someone do steal a , a or television or V C R or something like that
it is for drugs , you know , because you really ca n't on the street make any money off of it per se , you know ,
you going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it --
Yeah .
-- so you really not making a sizeable profit .
So it 's not really lucrative to take chances like that , you know , even though it , it does exist .
You know , I , just to diverge a little bit , uh , I live in an apartment .
Right now I 'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh
and , uh , the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in .
Right .
But , even so , it , I mean , it 's , it 's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to , to like lock the doors when they go out , you know , and things like --
Yeah .
-- that .
Uh-huh .
Uh , it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just , you know , sit out back , take a look at when people are here and when they 're not --
Uh-huh .
-- just come in , you know ,
there 's a T V and a V C R
and , they could , uh , they could get in pretty easy and , and especially , uh , since there are bedrooms upstairs --
Uh-huh .
-- and people leave the door open , you know , while they 're upstairs playing music ,
it could still happen then .
Yeah ,
that 's true ,
but you 'd be surprised also how , much people watch you that even not , uh , participating in any type crime .
I guess there was one case ,
I was surprised , uh ,
so happened this person worked at the same place ,
I work for Georgia Tech
and they work at the same place I did ,
but I did n't know that they had been watching me
because I was getting ready to , to go in my car one morning
and the first thing they said is , uh , you must do n't have to be to work at eight , you know ,
like shock ,
I , uh , get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED on national public radio .
Uh , that is one of my big sources for current events information .
Uh , I really like that coverage .
My wife , uh , on the other hand is home most of the day
and she watches a lot of the cable news network .
Have you seen , uh , h , have you , uh , ever heard of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED ?
No ,
we do n't have the , uh , national public radio in , in my area .
Uh-huh .
I can hear it at the , uh , uh , oh , the college town nearby when I 'm in Stillwater , which is about an hour away ,
but the F M signal does n't reach this far .
Uh-huh .
Uh , I 'll listen to shortwave quite a bit .
It gives you a whole different perspective on the news , uh , when you hear it from , say , a European --
Uh-huh .
-- point of view , or from the country of origin .
Uh , I agree with you , too , on the , uh , uh , the cable channel , C N N and HEADLINE NEWS .
Uh , I 'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , which is why I rely on shortwave and , and then the cable ,
.
cable , C N N .
I 'm , uh , interested in the , in the shortwave aspect of it .
Uh , how do you find that the , the coverage from other places in the world , uh , compares with the American coverage of ,
how do you think that , uh , the viewpoints differ ?
I think a lot of it is just , uh , the fact that in the U S you 're so far removed , uh , in a lot of cases from , say , conflicts
or , or it 's not happening in your backyard --
Uh-huh .
-- so it 's , it 's more of a , it 's not as a personal , uh , the news is n't as personal in what we receive domestically than , than what 's on shortwave .
It 's , B B C is , uh , oh , I do n't know the right word , is , is almost , uh ,
they almost take all emotions out of it when they --
Uh-huh .
-- report it
and it just ,
they seem to give more of just the facts than opinions .
Do you think , then , that , uh , the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts ?
Uh , very much so ,
very much so ,
and I , I think a lot of it is , uh , especially T V news ,
they do n't really have the time and a lot of them do n't have the education and the background to ,
.
uh , oh , to really decipher the news and to really explain it .
I mean , I , you know , I think it 's important to interpret it ,
but a lot of times the person does n't have the experience to , to do the interpreting .
Uh-huh .
Which , uh , which approach do you find to be , uh , more useful , the , the interpretive approach or the straight reporting ?
Oh , I like the straight reporting .
Uh , and then I , I hope to be able to form my own opinion of it .
It 's , it 's nice to hear someone 's interpretation of it --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , I always think it 's humorous when , when the President gives the State of the Union and , uh , for thirty minutes
and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard .
.
And a lot of time I do n't hear exactly what they , what they write into it .
Uh-huh .
So I , overall , I think I would rather hear just straight reporting .
One of the things that I found interesting last year during the , uh , the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against , uh , Peter Arnett , who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting , uh , some of the things that were available .
Uh , there was a , there was , uh , a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a crudely , uh , uh , hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory ,
and while he was being severely , uh , censored and could not make any judgment call on this , it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda ,
but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that , th- , you know , this is n't a baby milk factory ,
how could he say it was , uh ,
I , I think that ,
.
that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having the , not just the facts , but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them .
Yeah ,
I , I think people are , people have that opinion .
They , they want to sit down in front of the TV and , uh , or at a , read a magazine or U S A TODAY and read in four paragraphs , uh , and , and find out every- ,
So , let 's talk about the , uh , wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order
and after the fact , the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it .
What do you think ?
Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there ?
Well , actually , I do n't think they 're out of line .
De- , Devil 's advocate possibly ,
but it , you are trying to avoid paying taxes
and whe- , whether or not you agree with that law , i- , you 're still circumventing it .
You are legal in , in your circumvention of that law .
What , what if you 're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though ?
I mean what if you do n't even realize that you 're subject to paying , uh , income tax on something that you purchase mail order ?
Really , I , I , I do n't think that 's a valid argument .
I think that most people are quite aware they 're not paying that six percent sales tax .
Um , s- , s- , naturally some , some things you just ca n't find in your local K-Mart or , or , uh , Bryn Mawr stereo dealer .
Uh , but th- , th- , th- , then why not pay , pay the sales tax MUMBLEx .
Corporations have to ,
why should an individual just because it 's , just because the state ca n't really find out about it , be able to avoid paying sales tax ?
Well , I mean , it seems to me that , generally , at least in my own experience , when I purchase something mail order , it 's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania .
It 's because , I 'm sorry , the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania .
Yes .
Uh , it 's because I , I ca n't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area .
So I go outside the area for that .
And I think that it 's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though , you know , the revenue stream went to another state .
I do n't , I do n't think that that 's my responsibility as a , as a conscientious consumer .
I , I 'll agree it , it 's not your responsibility
but , b- , is it also legal ,
.
for you to do that ?
W , w , fr- , from what I understand from v , v , various net readings , i- , i- , it , the Federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes , uh , in , into place in the next few years .
It is , it is a lost revenue stream right now
and states c , can use all the revenue they can get .
With some , with something like that , d , do your arguments still apply ?
Well , I think that if , if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion , then I do n't argue with it .
Because it 's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh , I bought this out of state .
I need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania .
Which is exactly what businesses do at the present .
Right .
But the point is is that businesses do that .
The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question .
That 's a cost of doing business .
The burden --
And I , I --
-- should n't be placed on the consumer .
-- I was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having , having to pay sales tax on it .
Uh .
That 's my understanding of the way , uh , the way it works .
Usually , the , the person ordering does n't pay .
But the accounting department will , uh , suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay .
And there r- , there are s- , some substantial , nasty penalties , um , if you , if businesses try to avoid that .
Uh , do you mean businesses from the point of view as , of , of selling things to a consumer and --
I- , MUMBLEx .
-- then being responsible for the sales tax ?
No .
Businesses , uh --
Or purchasing .
-- if purchasing things mail order ,
if , if I 'm a computer consulting firm and I see these , this great deal on forty-six mother boards , uh , from , from say Utah .
Um , I , I might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax .
My a- , accounting department will at the end of the month .
I think that i- , i- , I think that 's the way things work in Pennsylvania .
And I know they work that way in , uh , say here in D C .
Yeah .
See I 'm unfamiliar with that because I do n't , I never see that end of the business .
Yeah .
So , my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer .
Uh , but , if that 's the case , if the business is responsible for policing themselves , then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that , uh , the opportunity f- , to forget that you owe sales tax for something , uh , can be avoided .
That 's true .
I- , i- , a r- , a big hole does exist right now , uh , in that consumers can just say oh , I , I forgot that .
There , there is no well defined mechanism at all
and , and that it is a a l- , loss . I , I think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism ju- , just to do just that in or- , in order to gain the revenue that 's being lost .
Uh , I mean , I , I do n't know if I agree with that .
But it , but ,
.
Kathy ?
Uh-huh .
Do you ,
So , what is your , uh , family ,
what do you usually do as far as budgeting ?
We have a very detailed budget . Because my husband is a finance major .
Uh-huh .
And we have , you know , we have money that we take out each month that we , uh , you know , for food and , and for , for gas and things like that .
And then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for Christmas and for , uh , other things .
Uh-huh .
Then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year
and we budget them into what we call our , our needs and wants list .
Uh-huh .
And so , uh , the things that , like a vacation .
We have a vacation fund .
We have a fund for the things we need . And then a , for the things that we want .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , and we 're continually putting into those , you know , each month how much we 're going to need
and then we know the month that we 're going to have enough to get that particular item .
Uh-huh .
So we very rarely buy anything on credit .
Everything we buy is paid for .
Yeah .
My husband is a finance major also .
.
And , uh , we kind of have the same plan .
Uh , we have one credit card
and every month we put , uh , you know , the same amount in for retirement .
Uh , and we budget , we 're , our , our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby .
So we 're ,
.
budgeting , uh , each month , uh , an allowance for his education --
Right .
-- starting now .
Right .
So that 's in our budget every month now .
That 's the newest addition .
But we too do the same thing as far as , uh ,
we have a set amount
we take , oh , one big vacation a year and then maybe , you know , three small vacations .
So we , you know , an ,
.
exact amount that we spend on that each year .
Right .
And ,
Uh , we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money . Uh --
Uh-huh .
-- instead of just writing checks for things .
Uh-huh .
If we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here .
I see .
And we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays , that we want to put in for , uh , the vacation . That we put in for Christmas .
Like you have a separate account for that then ?
Well , a lot of that , uh , I do n't know how safe it is .
I guess , uh , we keep it all in a safe here at the house .
Oh , I see .
Uh-huh .
And so it 's actually pulled out .
Then we keep our --
Oh , I see .
-- we have a savings account for the kids ' education .
That money goes into there .
Uh-huh .
Each of our ,
we have three children .
So they each have their own account .
I see .
That money is put into each month .
Uh-huh .
Does your husband deal in , uh , stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff ?
Th- , does he invest in that and --
He does somewhat .
-- for long-term ?
Yeah .
He does somewhat .
Uh-huh .
Uh , we have an investment plan .
Yeah .
I guess he does .
Uh-huh .
But , uh , we have really found ,
this is the first year we 've done it this way .
And we are really saving a lot of money .
Really .
Because you 're , you 've , you 've sat down with a piece of paper and said well let 's see what are we going to ,
so what goes into that , that particular thing ?
.
It 's vacations , Christmas .
Christmas , birthdays , uh , car maintenance , dental , medical ,
we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much --
Uh-huh .
-- we used on dental
and , uh , and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance does n't cover --
Right .
-- rather than wondering where it 's going to come from ,
we have it , you know .
Uh-huh .
And when , when we see something on sale , uh , instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we 've got enough and getting it , and then when something comes up , you know , kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill .
Uh-huh .
Everything 's taken care of .
And we 're finding that we even have more money than we thought .
Really .
Yeah .
Well , you know , uh , what do you do as far as ,
I , I take it ,
do you , uh , run the family budget as far as , uh , groceries and that sort of thing ?
I do .
Uh-huh .
All the money .
Uh-huh .
And how , what 's that ?
All the money is turned over to me .
Uh-huh .
Do you have a set amount that , that you spend each month
or --
Yes .
-- or how do you work that ?
I have a set amount .
It 's very generous
and I usually have extra .
Uh-huh .
And so then that can go , uh , you know , either back into our checking account
or I can just carry it over .
Uh-huh .
Uh , you know , there are certain months of the year that you 'll spend more on food than other months . And --
Uh-huh .
-- certain times when that will be left over .
But that 's completely up to me how I do that .
And --
Uh-huh .
-- then , uh , because I do n't work . I stay home .
I do too .
I stay home also .
And so it 's kind of my money
and I also get my own money to do what I want to . Go to lunches , you know , and do that kind of thing .
Uh-huh .
We have a clothing , uh , envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing .
Uh-huh .
It really works out great .
We 're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that .
And we 're ,
Yeah .
What , what ,
as far as like big things like something comes up and you have to buy a T V or a big item , like for the house .
How ,
do you have like a household ?
Yes .
We have a household budget .
Like we 're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that 's coming out of her crib this year .
Uh-huh .
And also , we need a new bed .
And so we 've got both of those budgeted
and we put a certain amount in each month
and we know which month we 'll enough saved to go buy those .
Uh-huh .
And if we find one on sale before then , then we can just take that and put it towards ,
MUMBLEx .
Well , here in Logan , Utah , we 've got a nice little valley here
and it 's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in
and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley .
Huh .
Well , here in Seattle , uh , it 's g , the air 's getting more and more polluted .
We 're , uh , we 're in kind of a basin .
And , uh , Seattle is on Puget Sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains .
And , uh , there 's been a lot , a lot of growth , population growth around here .
And , uh , it 's , uh , it 's getting worse .
I think --
Yeah .
-- most of it is from cars .
Yeah .
Definitely .
Here in Utah up along the Wasatch MUMBLEx along the western side of the , of these Rocky Mountains here , where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo
and Logan 's up in the valley a little bit further north ,
we get a lot of pollution
and it 's like seventy percent of it is from cars .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion .
And when we get ,
.
get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above
and it just sits and sits and sits
and we 're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of L A a few years ago .
Oh .
It 's not , it 's almost sad .
Because when I grew up here , it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys
and now it 's not in the mountain valleys .
Yeah .
Yeah ,
I live in the ,
.
university district
and , uh , uh , it 's supposed to have about the worst air pollution .
I think probably due to , uh , a lot of students going back and forth to school .
Huh .
And then we 're right next to Interstate Five also .
They 're getting serious about things like , uh , mandatory ,
well they 've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you 're in certain counties ,
emissions .
Oh , yeah .
MUMBLEx have they started doing that yet ?
Yeah .
They 've actually started doing it down along the ,
not in Logan up here cause we 're doing a lot better .
We have a lot , population is a lot lighter up here .
We have that here
and , uh , they 're , they 're expanding it to , uh , more counties here . Uh , as the population spreads out
and I think they 're also going to be making it , uh , mandatory for more cars .
Th- , th- , there was , uh , something in the law about if your car was over a certain age , like over twenty years old , you did n't have to get it done anymore .
And --
Yeah .
-- I think they 're eliminating that , uh --
Yeah .
They 're ge- , eliminating that out here .
-- that loophole .
Yeah .
They 're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun . Where they 're , uh , looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the , basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust .
Kind of like a radar gun .
And ...
Oh , really ,
You mean they could --
Yes .
-- do that remotely ?
Yeah .
Do it remotely just looking at the , what they do ,
they do several different types of things .
Sometimes they put a source light
and they look at the source light
and then as the car goes by , you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it
and you can look at the emissions actually .
Huh .
And ...
Now where does the source light go ?
Like across the street .
They 'll set up --
Oh , I see .
-- like a trap or something like that in some sense .
And they 're also looking at , uh , other , you know , ways of monitoring this and , cause they 've found out something basically that , uh ,
and a poorly tuned car can emit something ,
it 's an incredible amount .
It was like four hundred times as much --
Jeez .
-- uh , of certain pollutants , and it was like unburned hydrocarbons , then a properly tuned car .
And , and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars , well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the , the pollution then , you know , you , it 'd be one way to cut the pollution in half .
Yeah .
That 's neat .
.
But it 's also been , uh , oh , you know ,
everybody is talking about using more mass transient here
but it , uh , it 's tough , you know .
Like I 've , I 've looked into riding the bus to work
and I can drive to work in , uh , and get there in twenty to twenty-five minutes over a very congested corridor . Which goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges .
Uh-huh .
But if I , uh , if I take the bus , it requires several transfers
and it takes over an hour .
Huh .
So so it --
Yeah .
And they 're ...
-- it 's , it 's not hard to see why , why I keep driving .
And you know , I feel guilty cause I 'm driving a ,
Hi .
Hi .
Uh , uh I , I should say something .
Uh-huh .
That I 'm the , uh , least informed ,
this is totally accidental that I have to talk about this topic .
But , it 's , I 'm the least informed person in the whole United States .
.
This has not been determined yet
but I , I , I 've never read a newspaper in my entire life
and I 've , I , I never watch T V news nor listen to the news on the radio unless I 'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before I can turn it off .
But ,
Any particular reason ? .
Well , no .
I , I 've , I 've explored that with lots of people .
Uh , they 've tried to lock me up and , uh , things like that .
But , uh , uh , I 'm basically not interested
and I also find the , uh , everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and mis- , and off the , uh , uh ,
what am I trying to say . Uh ,
.
I do learn about things .
Uh-huh .
Huh .
Largely from friends
and I occasionally will read something like the NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS .
You know , someone will write a book about something
and then I 'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier .
Uh-huh .
But it ,
and somehow ,
and anything I participated in or know about when I read about it in the paper is always so , uh , covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that I do n't have much confidence in it .
But , I mean , I do n't think it 's just that I 'm lazy .
I really do n't ,
I , I , I like to refer to this as sort of CONSUMER REPORT phenomenon .
Uh-huh .
Which is everybody that I know reads CONSUMER REPORTS so the people who do feel that CONSUMER REPORTS does a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest .
Uh-huh .
But , assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas .
Uh-huh .
Uh , without thinking that there were people in , who think each other areas , area of , of specialty
and , uh , I guess you could explain it two ways .
And , and the cynical view is , well these things are n't doing a very good job at all .
And the view that I would rather take --
Uh-huh .
-- is that there 's a different amount of information you need when you 're particularly interested in a topic or , uh , particularly interested in buying something as a , you know --
Right .
-- as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things .
Yeah .
And I think the same thing is true with news .
If you want to just have an idea as to what 's going on , most papers , a- , and especially the better papers , the , the TIMES , the WALL STREET JOURNAL , the --
Uh-huh .
-- WASHINGTON POST give you a reasonable idea .
Yeah .
If you were deeply involved in it , then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they 're not printing because the average person does n't need or want to know --
Right .
Does n't want ,
-- that much .
Let me ask , by the way , just for the record .
I , I 'm , I totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them .
So , I mean , I 'm not being elitist in that sense , I hope . Uh ,
Well , I mean , there 's , there 's a reasonable question as to whether it 's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things .
Yeah .
What ,
And most people think it is
and I can , I can , you know , accept that some people think it 's not and can find better ways to use it .
Yeah .
By the way when you say most people think it is ,
I think it 's like ninety-nine point ninety-nine think it is , percent .
I do n't think it 's that high .
Oh , you do n't ?
I know a lot of people who may watch the T V news in the evening but do n't spend the time to actually read a newspaper .
Right .
And I think they 're saying well if something 's really important , I 'll at least find out that it happened .
Yeah .
And , and that 's a , that 's , is a reasonable start
and for awhile I did n't read a newspaper when I came out here because I did n't find one that I liked .
Uh , and if something important happened , it was covered on T V
and I could then go and , and pick up newspapers if , if it were important enough to read about .
Uh-huh .
And I imagine you get the same level of MUMBLEx something that you cared about happened , you 'd find out from friends or other channels .
Yeah .
Uh , I did , on the , uh , the Supreme Court hearings , ar- , the , for , uh , uh , the whole business of , uh ,
see I actually have a , a ,
Clarence Thomas or ,
Yeah ,
the Thomas and Anita Hill business .
Right .
I , I mean that 's , that 's the closest thing .
I deeply cared about that .
Uh-huh .
Uh , and I sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine
and when I arrived at her house , she was engrossed in that .
We ended up watching it for a couple of hours . Zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and ea- , watching it some more .
And I thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on .
But even then , I did n't end up doing it on my own . Uh , uh ,
Yeah .
I stayed as far away from those as I could .
Uh-huh .
I decided I did n't want to waste the time
I had , I guess , five years ago now , wasted that kind of time with Oliver North hearings .
Right ,
right .
Yeah .
And afterwards , decided that what I had gotten out of it just was n't worth the time I put in .
Uh-huh .
And that these things are just very slow in seeing information --
Yeah .
-- come out .
Do you ever read ,
Wha , what sort of company do you work for ?
Do you work for a big or a little place ?
Uh , I work for Georgia Tech .
Yes sir .
I work for the research facility .
Uh , and it 's , it 's kind of small in a sense
but it , it does have , about , uh , I guess , two thousand civil employees .
Uh-huh .
And , on a , a scale , I guess it 's still considered small .
It just have a lot of different laboratories .
Uh-huh .
The area I work in , it , it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so .
Uh-huh .
So that 's make up most of the laboratory
so from , from that standpoint , it 's pretty small --
Uh-huh .
-- it 's pretty small .
What about yourself ?
Huh .
Well , I , I work for , uh , actually probably similar kind of place .
I work for , uh , Lincoln Laboratory .
Oh , okay .
Uh , yeah .
We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech .
Oh , okay .
I see .
Uh , and , uh ,
so we 're , we 're part , we 're actually part of M I T .
So it 's very much the same kind of place and , uh --
Oh , okay .
-- the technical institution .
Right . Uh ,
Uh , while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to , trying to think of what , uh , uh , what things were important , uh , besides salary and a , and a job . I guess , uh , MUMBLEx list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the , uh , the challenge of the work and , uh --
Uh-huh .
-- the working conditions , things like that .
Right .
I do n't know .
What are your , uh , what sorts of things would you consider important ?
Well those and probably the security aspect of it .
Uh-huh .
Because a lot of time nowadays , even though you 're working , uh , you 're treated ,
and it may not be true in every place .
In a lot of cases I think you 're treated more like a number instead of a , a person .
Uh-huh .
Because when it come down to layoff , they do n't really consider people and , and , you know , their well being as far as , you know , how they going , their next dollar going to come in .
How they going to pay their bills .
They just lay them off .
Yeah .
And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had , uh ,
I think the company still exists .
What they use to do is , they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off --
Uh-huh .
-- you know .
That way that , you know , one person would n't get one big blunt blow at one time .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , you know , I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better , you know , other than s- , you know , something like ,
unemployment is good
but I mean the company as a whole
because you as an employee , even the company is making money ,
they paying you a salary
but you are responsible for that company growth .
You 're responsible also for helping that company get to the par- , point that it 's at at making profits .
So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than , you know , uh , neglect or something like that .
Uh-huh .
You know . Because it 's not a person 's fault that , you know , people not buying or businesses are , are not on the up and up all the time , you know .
I do n't see how one or two people , maybe more one or two , but , you know , a number of people can , can be the downfall of com- , a company situation .
Now how do you mean that ?
I know it ,
Well in a sense that say , how do you make a , a conclusion that you 're going to lay off these ten people .
Uh-huh .
Uh , for the bad times of the company .
What about the , the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well .
Uh-huh .
You know . In that standpoint .
Well , you , you think it 's better than to , to try to spread the , the effort equally among all the employees of the company
or ,
Ye- , yes ,
I do .
Uh-huh .
I really do .
I think it 'd be better that way
and even at that , it would at least give the person time to look for another job because --
Uh-huh .
-- they know that MUMBLEx that there are problems
and , you know , there are reason to look for another job --
Yeah .
-- instead of just dumping it on them all at one time .
Uh-huh .
You know . That 's just , that 's my views , you know .
Yeah .
I 've heard of a couple of companies that have done that .
I think , uh , back about , a few years ago when things were tough , Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile .
They went to a , uh , a , a four and a half day work week rather --
Right .
-- than cut , yeah , just cut everybody back ten percent .
Right .
And , uh , have to , give everybody a half day a week off .
Right .
And I think you can do that for a little while
but I 'm ,
Well at least that would give a person a chance to look --
Yeah .
-- you know . Because the way it is , a person really do n't have a chance .
All right , have you lived in this area long ?
No ,
I 've only been here a couple of years .
Okay .
Uh , but , uh , I 've , I 've noticed that , uh , this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past .
Yeah ,
it , it , it 's , it 's a lot warmer , a lot drier too , because usually about this time of year , this , you know , you see a little bit more rain .
I mean by , by mid February , I mean , we start getting a lot of rain .
Yeah ,
yeah ,
well I remember last year , or the year before ,
But it ,
uh , we had ice and snow , uh , uh ,
terrible ice storm , uh , around this time of the year .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , this year it 's been so hot and , uh , sunny
it , it 's really quite , uh , quite amazing .
Yeah ,
unseasonable .
I used to , my wife and I we used to live in San Antonio , couple years ago ,
Uh-huh .
and it was , it was I remember the first day of Spring ,
it was so much ice that came down , later on that afte- , that afternoon and evening ,
Um .
it was just , it was horrible .
Yes ,
I was just talking to my son today ,
he 's up in Boston ,
.
and it was twenty-nine there
and it was , you know , in the seventies out here
and ,
Yeah .
it was really , uh ,
he really wished he could be here , rather than there .
Yeah ,
well , um , I do n't know
I , I guess I 'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather .
Oh really .
Um , I , I like it warmer ,
I mean I like it , you know , I like it warm
but it does n't really matter .
I mean , I 'd , I would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly
but , uh ,
Uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
I have , you know ,
I , I , don- ,
I think it 's really been delightful .
I come , uh , I 've spent most of my time in , in warm weather areas
and , uh , uh , the ice and snow just does n't , uh , hold any allure for me at all .
Well I spent three years in Germany ,
so I 'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway .
.
But I got used to it ,
it was really strange ,
I mean , when I , when , when , when we came to San Antonio it was just like , uh , you know , it just , just swelter
and then we got used to it
and then we went up to Dallas
and it was just ,
it 's , it 's not , not that it 's just hot or dry ,
it 's just not very comfortable ,
it just ,
Her- ,
do you , you think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas .
Yeah ,
a little bit .
Uh-huh .
Yeah .
You must , well , uh ,
it must be quite a bit hotter down there , is n't it ?
Yeah ,
my wife and I , the last day we were in Florida , we , my visiting my , uh , my parents , and my brother and sister ,
we were , we were down there
and , the last day , right before we left , we had to , I had to ride with my sister
and the air conditioning went out on the car ,
Oh , wow .
and , we , you , you just get used to air conditioning all the time ,
Oh yes .
and this ,
it was just ,
the humidity was like eighty plus , eighty percent plus
and it was just killing us .
Oh yeah ,
it 's terrible .
Orlando is the only place I 've ever been where I 've seen the car sweat .
Yeah .
I mean , that 's really bad .
Yeah ,
well , I mean , I , I , I guess I 've been in some places , you know , where the weather was just so mild , you know , places like Monterey , California or ,
Uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
you know ,
just , you know , so mild ,
and then you 've been to such extremes like San Angelo , Texas where you just , where you walk outside and you sweat ,
you know you 're sweating ,
Yeah .
you look down at your arm ,
but you see the water leaving your arm ,
it 's so hot ,
Oh wow , uh .
you just feel it pulling away , bizarre .
I know I , I tend to , I tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it 's very temperate .
Yeah .
Uh it does n't ,
some people say , uh , they , they like to watch the changing of the seasons
but , uh , I 'd rather , you know , like southern California , you know , have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time .
Yeah .
So , it 's kind of a luxury .
I tend to agree
but , I do n't know ,
I , I think , in , in some , in some respects it probably MUMBLEx more tolerable .
Yeah ,
well I guess this , the weather is n't as lively a topic as , uh , as some of the others we might have gotten .
No ,
the other topics .
I got one topic ,
they said talk about the Middle East situ- , well ,
I guess we 're supposed to say good-bye or something , and think about what
my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye .
We messed up the conversation , anyway .
Well I mean I 've had some pretty bad , I guess some pretty controversial topics
so it 's just like well that was my fault .
But then the weather 's like ,
man , I mean , it gets pretty mundane ,
I mean you can only talk about , about the situation just so long .
Yeah ,
I know ,
weather 's just not all that inspiring .
Okay ,
well it 's nice talking to you .
Okay .
Bye-bye .
Bye .
pretty good ,
pretty good .
So we 're talking about drug testing in the work place , huh .
Drug testing in the work place .
Um . I 've been tested a few times , just before pre- , drug employment .
But that 's about it .
I 've never had random drug testing .
Yeah ,
we have random drug testing at , in my business ,
but I 've never been , uh , never had to do it .
Oh , really ?
Yeah ,
yeah ,
they started that about a year ago ,
and I think it 's mostly for the , the field people that , you know , drive trucks and heavy machinery , that kind of stuff .
Uh-huh .
But , uh , they , they have done some testing around our office , mostly after lunch , looking for people drinking , uh , drinking beer and stuff at lunch time ,
at least that 's .
Oh , they do with alcohol .
Pardon ?
They do it with alcohol ?
Yeah ,
yeah ,
they , they , they 'll check for alcohol .
Oh , I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine .
No ,
once , once you start doing that stuff , you sort of , you 're sort of stuck into , uh , checking for the whole , the whole thing .
Huh . That 's interesting .
Yeah ,
it 's a ,
What type of field of work are you in ?
I 'm in the oil business .
Oh , in the oil business .
Yeah .
Okay ,
and you work in the office around .
Yeah ,
I work in the office ,
so , uh , it 's pretty , pretty safe environment .
Uh-huh .
.
Yeah
see , I work in the automotive air bag industry , where we make the safety bags --
Uh-huh ,
uh-huh .
-- for the cars ,
and we work around a lot of explosives .
Well , that sounds like kind of an important job to be , uh , straight on .
Yeah ,
so that 's , you know ,
I 'm all for it , because the , well , the type of environment I work in , you know , they 're working with explosives ,
and so they could blow up the whole ,
well , they have safety features with each of the explosives they use ,
but still , it can be dangerous .
Yeah ,
yeah ,
well , I , I , I agree .
I think that , uh , you know , under certain circumstances , especially when you 're working in , in high risk , uh , uh , industries , where you can really hurt other people , that , that you need to have that kind of stuff .
Yeah .
You know ,
if it 's ,
as long as it 's not abused , uh , you know , random , you know ,
as long as it 's random , and , and the individual 's rights are , uh , are protected , I do n't have that big a problem with it .
Now do they fire them , or do they ?
Well , see , this is it ,
this is where I start having my problems with my company .
I work for a private company ,
and --
Uh-huh .
-- and the policy is something like , see if I can re- , state this correctly now . If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem , then you 're eligible for company counseling .
Uh-huh .
But if they catch you , if you test positive for a , a controlled substance , then you get fired .
Oh , wow .
So , it , you know , it 's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos .
Huh , that 's .
I think our policy is that ,
all right , it 's probably the same thing .
I 'm not really sure what the ,
Yeah ,
really ,
it 's one of those things that you read once ,
and then , if you , if you 're not worried about it , you just forget about it .
That 's right .
But I know , they do have counseling , and that they do give you a second chance ,
but I 'm not sure if --
Yeah .
-- if it 's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in .
Yeah ,
yeah ,
our company 's a little tougher on the second chance .
I mean , if , if they 're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in , then they ought to , you know , go out of the way , I think , a little bit more to , uh , to help you get , help get you rehabilitated to , you know , to get get back at your job .
Uh-huh .
But , uh , when you 're not , when you 're a private company , the rules do n't always apply .
Uh , do you think it works very good with that random , do you think it limits ,
Well , it 's , it 's hard for me to , to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment
