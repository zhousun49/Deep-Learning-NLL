Okay .
So ,
I guess ,
What kind of experience do you , do you have , then with child care ?
I think , uh , I wonder if that worked .
Does it say something ?
I think it usually does .
You might try , uh ,
I do n't know ,
hold it down a little longer ,
and see if it , uh ,
Okay .
Well ,
Okay
I ,
Does it usually make a recording or s- ,
Well , I do n't remember .
It seemed like it did ,
but it might not .
I guess --
Okay .
-- I guess we can start . Uh ,
Okay .
No ,
I do n't , I do n't have any kids .
I , uh , my sister has a , she just had a baby ,
he 's about five months old
and she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and --
Uh-huh .
-- the different ,
do you have kids ?
I have three .
Oh , really ?
Uh-huh .
.
Yeah ,
I do .
Yes , uh ,
I do n't work , though ,
but I used to work and , when I had two children .
Uh-huh .
I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit ,
but I do n't envy anybody who 's in that situation to find day care .
Yeah .
But , does your sister live in a big community ?
Uh , yeah
she lives ,
it 's a , it 's a fairly large community .
She , uh , got real lucky , though .
He had a boss who , uh , moved into a larger office --
Uh-huh .
-- and she 's able to take her baby to work with her .
Oh , really ?
And it 's a small office that she works in --
Uh-huh .
-- and , uh , it 's a , it 's a legal firm , office ,
and it 's just one lawyer --
Um .
-- and so she 's the only one really that takes care of the office .
There 's no one else that works there .
Uh-huh .
And so they have an extra room and everything for the baby ,
so it works out pretty good for her .
Wow .
.
How lucky .
I , I know a lot of people around here sometimes have , like , mothers or grandmothers --
Yeah .
-- that take care of their kids
and , but , the community I 'm in is not a real large one ,
so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that , you know ,
you either know them or know somebody who knows them , to get to ,
Yeah ,
so it 's fairly safe .
Yeah ,
to get references and that ,
so , but , uh ,
I , I d- , do n't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center , but , simply because there 's so many kids and so many ,
Worried that they 're not going to get enough attention ?
Yeah ,
and , uh , you know , colds and things like that get --
Yeah .
-- spread real easy and things ,
but , and they 're expensive
and , course , there 's a lot of different types of day care available , too , you know , where they teach them academic things .
Yes .
Or they just watch them and let them play and things like that ,
but ,
take a long time to find the right place
.
Yeah ,
and you , and you do n't always even know if it 's , it 's going to be the right place or not .
Uh-huh .
Anything , I guess , could happen .
Uh-huh .
Because after , I guess after he , you know , gets to a certain age she 's going to have to take him to a day care .
Uh-huh ,
when he starts toddling around and stuff .
Yeah .
Yeah .
When , when he 's not , when she ca n't keep control of him
and he starts crawling
that 's ,
Uh-huh .
It would be hard ,
I think it would be kind of stressful .
It would be nice to have him around --
Uh-huh .
-- but , uh , seems like , you know ,
goll- ,
what if he cried at the wrong time
or the phone rang or ,
.
you know , at the wrong time .
Yeah .
But ,
I think she has problems with that , too .
Uh-huh .
Well , when you have kids , will you work ?
Do you --
I do n't know --
-- work now ?
-- that 's something I 've considered . Uh ,
Uh-huh .
I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time .
Uh-huh .
Is that what you do ?
Uh , yeah .
Actually , I teach my kids at home ,
so I 'm here all the time .
Oh , so they do n't go to school .
Is it like , uh ,
oh , what 's that called ,
it 's , uh , correspondence school ,
they do it --
Uh-huh .
-- at home .
Yeah ,
yeah .
That 's interesting .
So ,
Do you have to have any special training ?
Not ,
it depends on the state you live actually .
Some laws absolutely prohibit it .
Some states , uh , say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that .
Our state does n't yet , say that
and I 'm not a certified teacher .
I went to college ,
but I , you know , but my kids are only elementary grades , levels right now
and so ,
So they have n't been to public schools at all .
One of them was for a couple of years
and so , you know , my oldest , he was ,
and then my youngest two have never been .
Um .
So anyway ,
but we do n't ,
So , you 've never had ,
Well , uh , does the company you work for test for drugs ?
Actually , uh , they just recently started a policy of testing drugs , which was kind of interesting ,
because w , when I went to work for them , uh , they did n't do that ,
but , uh , since then they 've , they 've started a drug testing policy , not because of their own , uh , convictions , but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that .
Huh .
How about you ?
Uh , no ,
we 're not being tested for drugs at all , uh ,
our policies and procedures manual , uh , the furthest it goes about drugs is in the , kind of the miscellaneous section , or --
Uh-huh .
-- its reasons for immediate dismissal ,
it says , use of narcotics on company premises .
Um .
So that 's pretty general ,
but , uh , I work for an environmental management firm --
Okay .
-- and I 'm an engineer there ,
but I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites ,
but I do n't operate any machinery .
Yeah .
Now , people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that --
Uh-huh .
-- are under a , a medical monitoring program ,
because they 're at a higher risk of exposure
and blood screening is part of that
and I , I think that drugs ,
they do test for drugs in that capacity ,
but it 's not their exclusive ,
it 's just part , it 's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for .
Yeah .
But I think it 's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field .
What is the nature of your company 's business ?
Well , it 's actually , uh ,
we do oil well services .
So , a lot of our clients are oil companies , big oil companies ,
and they go out to ,
we have engineers who , uh , go out to the oil well , to the , to the client 's oil well , and , and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff ,
so the clients are very concerned that , you know , the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy , because they 're on their , their , you know , territory and everything ,
but --
Um .
-- the thing that 's interesting is that I w- , I 'm an engineer and , a software engineer
and I work in the software , uh , house ,
and everybody there , you know , are all software engineers .
They 've never , you know , they never go out to the , the oil rigs or anything ,
and yet , we 're getting , we 're subjected to this policy , you know , the same one that , uh , th- , all the engineers have to , to ,
well , a little different , actually ,
but , uh , you know , we have to go through the same thing ,
and it 's , but it 's , uh , it 's a little different , I guess than , than a lot of drug policies .
In our case , it 's like , when you hire on , they 'll test you ,
and then if you get injured on the job , if you like trip and fall or something , uh , they give you a drug test right away .
Oh , really ?
Other than that they do n't have random testing or anything like that ,
but , a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first .
Particularly , like , uh , we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol ,
and tha- , they did n't find any problem with that , you know ,
but ,
Right .
Uh ,
We , that 's been an , a , an issue , uh , in our company even though we do n't have the random or even regular drug screening .
In fact , they 'll have these little parties ,
and people will just get ,
I mean , I 've ,
my brother lives where I work ,
and I have many a time called him to come get me , you know .
And , uh , uh , but , y- , you know , they do n't think twice about serving beer by the keg .
Yeah .
You know ,
but , uh , I think drug testing ,
and I , I do n't know ,
I guess I k- , I think it 's got some relevance ,
but I think its relevance is pretty limited .
I mean , I think , you know ,
in your case , I do n't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing .
Yeah .
I think that 's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident .
Yeah ,
it 's really , it 's really bizarre .
Uh , particularly , like where we are , you know .
I , I ,
there was a story of a woman last year who , who actually did slip on the ice and , and like sprained her ankle
and she , she was a personnel secretary
and she had to get tested
and , I do n't know
I 'm ambivalent about the whole thing .
I , you know , I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand , it 's like if , you know ,
they 're , they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense
and , you know , it 's like you 're , I mean , employments are contractual by nature anyway --
Uh-huh .
-- but , uh , I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job that , where I had to , uh , uh , do a drug test
and , and it 's , it was kind of a long story ,
but it was , it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through ,
and it amounted to , uh , going in , uh , before any of these interviews ,
I 'm not even working for this company ,
I 'm going in for , like , interviews
and they flew me out to Chicago
and , and , uh , before I went into any of the interviews , uh , they took me to the doctor to give me a physical .
They said it was going to be a physical , you know ,
and , uh , actually bec- , beforehand they told me they were going to , uh , do drug screening ,
but I had forgotten about that ,
and so , basically , I 'd already peed off in that morning
and , and when I got in there , I did n't , I was n't , like , able to give a full sample ,
and so --
Oh .
-- they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes , drink a whole ton of water --
Right .
-- before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again ,
and the , and the , the procedure is utterly humiliating .
You go in there with the doctor ,
he makes you take off all your clothes
and then he examines you .
Uh , the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a , uh , long term financial plan and monthly budget .
The only thing I do now is , uh , put the data into Quicken .
I do n't know if you are familiar with that .
Yeah ,
I have some friends of mine who use Quicken
and , uh , I 've considered using it once myself ,
but I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date .
Uh-huh .
So I , I kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken , at least for now .
Um . I 've found it 's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then , well , uh , uh , not bother to total it --
Uh-huh .
-- and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic .
So it really helps with that .
Yeah ,
well , it 's similar problems
but , uh , we just have the one check book
and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible
and occasionally we will get behind like you say
but , uh , it does n't really seem to be too , too tight if we just remember to keep everything up , up to date and balanced .
Uh-huh .
Well , how to you handle that , the long range or medium range planning on finances ?
Well , actually we have n't had to . Uh , until just recently .
I guess we 've got a , a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way
so --
Uh-huh .
-- we needed to start doing more of that just for , uh , you know , saving for college and things like that .
We tried a way , try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that .
Yeah .
Well that 's pretty good if you can do that .
I know .
I have a daughter who 's ten
and we have n't really put much away for her college up to this point
but , uh , we 're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away --
Uh-huh .
-- for college ,
so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction --
Um .
-- in the fall
and then the money that I will be making this summer we 'll be putting away for the college fund .
Um . Sounds good .
Yeah ,
I guess we 're , we 're just at the point , uh ,
my wife worked until we had a family
and then , you know , now we 're just going on the one income
so it 's --
Uh-huh .
-- a lot more interesting trying to , uh ,
find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to , uh , do it .
You know , kind of enforce the savings .
Uh-huh .
But , uh , it will be interesting to see MUMBLEx .
Well our situation is just a little bit , kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently , uh , took on a full time job , well almost full time .
Um .
So , it 's only recently that we 've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for , uh , long range goals like college and sickness and --
Um .
-- travel and that kind of thing .
That sounds good .
But , uh , uh , I was just curious , what , uh , part of the country .
Oh , Stockton .
Oh , okay .
How about you ?
Uh , Cincinnati , actually .
I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with , uh , the western accents or something like that .
I do n't know how many people are , uh , getting involved in this
but --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , well that 's interesting .
I 'm , uh , uh , actually , uh , I was kind of interested if you found out about the study by , uh , reading TELECOM DIGEST
or was there another ?
Uh , a colleague of mine at , uh , work got some information over , uh , the computer network called INTERNET .
Oh , okay .
Yeah ,
that is how I got it as well
but , uh ,
And he just forwarded that on to me
and , uh , it sounded like it would be an interesting project --
Uh-huh .
-- to participate in
so I --
Yeah ,
it will be interesting to see what ,
-- sent back MUMBLEx mail .
It would be interesting to see how the data base ,
MUMBLEx so , well , I guess we 're talking about the experiment .
Uh-huh .
Uh , probably need to try to get back on the topic
but , uh , it 's hard to talk about finances without without getting to , uh , dollar figures I guess --
Uh-huh .
-- you know ,
we could talk about some of the long range goals
and ,
Well what other long range goals do you have besides college ?
Uh , well I think , either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that .
It seems like every year my employer just gives back , you know , a little bit your tuition reimbursement .
Uh-huh .
I mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent
and now it 's , uh , now it 's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class
and , uh , it 's a real shame from what we had before , uh , because we 're ,
Right ,
uh , actually I lived over in Europe for a couple of years ,
I lived in Germany
and in Germany they do n't have the jury system .
What they do is they have , uh , three judges , basically .
And you get up there
and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence
and your defense attorney presents their evidence
and those three guys take the evidence , go off , figure it out and then come back and say whether you 're guilty or not .
Ou- , ou- , our judicial system is in such total chaos .
.
I think what they need to do is , they need to somehow take the money out of it .
I mean , when you have a man that 's signed a , a , a statement saying he 's guilty ,
we have a , a family called All day family .
They were all murdered .
Uh-huh .
All the people signed confessions ,
they went to a trial by jury .
They been trying these people now for twenty-two years , ever since I was a child .
Wow .
And what they 've done is they 've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they 've done ,
has nothing to do with justice whatsoever .
Well , you know , it 's , it 's one of those things ,
I mean , uh , uh , I would have to look at it .
I- , if they did it with the , uh , just the judges , the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight
because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day , they know all the procedures ,
they know what 's good and what is n't ,
they 'd be able to say , I 'm sorry ,
you ca n't use this as , uh , evidence , you know , because it was either illegally obtained or whatever
and , you know , you would n't have this , uh , uh , theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the , to the jury
and then the judge says , oh , no ,
d , disregard that .
Come on ,
any jury 's not going to disregard the evidence , you know .
Uh , that 's true .
I , I , I think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself .
That may very well be .
I , I hold it in the utmost contempt .
Uh ,
The , uh , d- , my favorite is the police department ,
they 're not aimed at the criminal .
The judicial system is aimed at the citizens
because you and I , we have work schedules ,
we can be called at work ,
we have Social Security numbers ,
they can trace us down ,
we have telephones ,
then we have checkbooks .
Criminals have none of these things .
They 're real difficult to catch ,
and if they do catch them , they do n't get any monetary gain out of it , whereas us , we write a check .
Yeah .
So where do you think they target their efforts ?
That 's true .
You d- ,
They target their efforts toward the citizens --
Well ,
-- not the criminals .
How would you go about changing it ?
You know , that 's a ,
I 've nailed the problem down
but I ,
.
.
Leave the details up to somebody else , huh .
Yeah ,
I 'm going to have to leave those details like , what would you do about ,
I think , to begin with , you would h , you would have ,
like , here in Atlanta area , our crime rate is just astronomical ,
yet , you go out on the streets
and they 're giving speeding tickets .
Yeah .
I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from ,
Well , you know , uh , talking about the lawyers , you know what might very well do , uh , cause a , uh , a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that , is to set the fees for cases .
It 's kind of like do it , do it in the similar vein similar , like , uh , V C R or television repair .
If you take your T V in , a lot of these T V repair places will say , well , I 'll repair your T V for a hundred dollars ,
and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that 's really tremendously wrong with it , then he eats it .
He , he repairs it , gives it back to you , and takes your hundred dollars .
Now , if he comes in and says , you know , I 'll repair your , your V C R , or somebody else 's V C R , for a hundred dollars , gets in there ,
maybe it 's a blown fuse ,
takes him two minutes ,
he fixes it ,
he still charges you that hundred dollars .
So , maybe if we did that with the lawyers , so that , you know , whether it 's a murder case or a , you know , a civil , uh , somebody suing somebody else , you get X dollars for that case
and that 's it .
Now ,
None of this ,
I firmly believe in that
because when you get the most heinous of crimes , have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney ?
Oh , yeah .
And here 's this bum that did n't have a job --
Yeah .
-- and he 's got a attorney that you and I could never afford .
That 's true .
Who 's --
Yeah .
-- paying for that ?
Um , y- , well , you , you know , you 're talking to part of them that 's paying for that .
Yeah ,
and you 're talking to the other half that 's paying for it
.
That 's right .
You know that 's , it , it 's , it 's amazing
and , and when you stop and look at it , I mean , the judges , th- , they 're all former lawyers .
Yeah ,
well , that 's another problem .
I think to really correct the judicial system , you have to get the lawyers out of it .
.
I mean , they 're , they 're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever ,
and with that type person running it , I mean , you , you could expect that you ,
Do you know anyone that , uh , is , is in a nursing home or has ever been in one ?
No .
But I , my grandparents were looking into it before
so I know what they 've said .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Well , I 'm trying to think .
My , uh , uh , wife 's grandmother had Alzheimer 's
and they were going to put her into a , a nursing home
and , uh , they , when they put her in , she had all kinds of trouble
and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a , a , you know , a , a nuisance . Or worse than a nuisance ,
I mean --
Oh they thought it was too much of a bother .
-- she sort of went , you know , bananas
and they could n't , could n't deal with her .
So , I guess you need to , uh , know whether it 's a , you know , a no deposit , no return kind of thing whether ,
Right .
If they 're equipped too , to handle the kind of patients you 're going to have --
Yeah .
-- you know , put in there too .
Because I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still .
Right .
They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her
but they wanted to be independent as well .
Right .
Have their own room .
My grandmother actually was in a , a nursing home that , uh ,
there was a retirement hotel and then a , uh ,
there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it
so for , uh , the first few years she had her own apartment and , you know , made her own meals sometimes . But could , could also go and eat someplace else .
Uh-huh .
And then , uh , as she became less able to take care of herself , then she moved into this other part that was able to , uh , provide full-time care
and , uh , she did n't have to do anything anymore .
But my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly .
And that 's som- ,
I do n't know whether that 's because they , you know , sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the , the reason is .
But I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something .
Well a lot of it 's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help .
Yeah .
They need health care
so they 're already ill before they go .
Right .
That 's probably a large factor .
Yeah .
If , if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you , then you stay where you are .
Then you only go there as a last resort .
Uh-huh .
Or people send you there as a last resort .
Right ,
right .
That 's what my grandparents ,
it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened , there was somebody there for them .
Uh-huh .
So that was their thinking .
Somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency .
Right .
And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make .
Right .
So they would n't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time .
I guess that 's a problem too for people . Wait lists and all .
Yeah ,
I guess .
That , uh ,
you ca n't always get in when you want too
and of course , you ca n't just sit around and wait .
Right .
When you need it , you need it --
Yeah .
-- I guess .
And the money is also another issue . How you 're going to pay for it .
Right .
At that stage of life you only have so much money left
and I guess it 's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings .
Yeah .
I mean it is kind of fair ,
but it 's also not fair because they have their own children to raise .
Sure .
So it 's another problem .
And you probably , if it were you , you probably would n't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price .
Right ,
right .
So , it , it 's just so complicated anymore , I think .
People outlive their savings .
And , with medicine being the way it is , you 're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down
and they 're not necessarily enjoying life anymore .
Yeah .
Well maybe that 's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it 's not worth continuing .
It 's just a shame that 's the way it has to be .
I think --
Yeah .
-- the retirement home idea 's a nice idea . To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay
and cause like if your spouse died , MUMBLEx all alone , it 'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you .
Right .
To have friends .
Yeah ,
I 've known quite a few people that have , uh , gone to retirement communities .
I do n't know if they have them back there
but here in California and in Ari- ,
Okay .
Uh , so , what do you think , uh , about putting the elderly in a nursing home ?
Well , I think that it , it varies on on the individual basis .
Huh .
Uh , sometimes it is , there is no alternative .
Uh-huh .
Uh , you do not have , uh , uh , family available or family that 's , uh ,
you may not even have family that is , uh , uh , in , you know , who are around .
That 's true .
Yeah .
So , sometimes it 's not an alternative .
Huh .
And I think , uh , but I think also , sometimes it can be , uh , a benefit if it 's for a short time .
Sometimes in a nursing home --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , especially if , if it 's after an acute illness .
To get over a ,
or to rehab after , uh , an illness .
That 's true .
I never thought of that .
Yeah .
Sometimes you know , sometimes the nursing homes are good for , uh , just short periods of time .
That 's true ,
until they get over that hump --
Uh-huh .
-- of whatever it is they 're dealing with .
Because too often the acute hospitals will , are sending them out much faster than what they 're --
Yes .
-- really able to .
They really are .
They do n't like to keep them --
So --
-- longer than a week .
-- so there is some good to it .
Yeah .
Uh , sometimes too , it 's used as a dumb job .
You know the fam- , --
What do you mean ?
-- well the families do not necessarily , uh , know what to do with them
and they do n't want to take the responsibility
so they will put them in a nursing home .
Yeah ,
that 's true .
So you see , uh ,
there 's both sides to it too .
What do you think ?
Yeah
and it depends on how , how sick the person is too . What you 're capable of , like if you have a family to take care of , you know , of your own .
Yeah .
Yeah ,
uh , I would personally like it
if my parents were to get ill , I would like to take care of them at home and if I had the money with some help .
That 's not always possible .
That 's true .
But , uh , to the best of my ability , I 'd like to do it until it gets impossible .
I think that 's also where you 're going to have a lot of people who are going to ,
it 's there 's not a choice , it 's --
Right .
-- because , it 's not economically feasible even to --
Uh-huh .
-- put them in a nursing home .
Yeah .
So that , that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the , uh , either Medicare or insurance to cover it .
That 's true .
Yeah .
So ,
But I think nursing homes can be good .
It just depends on what kind they are .
You know , you need to check them out ahead of time .
Yeah ,
and then there 's also some that are set up for specialties --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , I know some .
Unfortunately , some elderly have to go to or have , I guess it 's Alzheimer 's or where --
Uh-huh .
-- they wonder or , or , uh , confused or have some mental problem .
Yeah ,
that they 're ,
And you need a special nursing home for that .
You need one that has a unit that 's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around --
Yeah .
-- and you need people who are trained for that type --
Right .
-- of problem .
Who know what they 're doing with that .
Yeah
so , so there 's different types of nursing homes I think .
Yeah
well , my , uh , grandmother 's not really in a nursing home , but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it .
And she really liked the idea of , of moving there .
She 's not ill yet --
Uh-huh .
-- but , uh , she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years
and then she decided that , uh , she 's eighty five years old , that eventually , you know , she she does n't want her family taking care of her and being a burden .
She 's very independent .
So she 's in this nursing home .
It 's out in the country
and , uh , she really enjoys it right now because she does n't have to wash dishes or cook .
Gives her a little bit of her own independence --
Uh-huh .
-- but she still has , uh , a security there .
Right .
Some support .
And then there 's also , uh , sort of a wing for those people that do get sick
and , what I like about it and I think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now
and then , so if she ever does become ill , uh , it will be like family around her .
That 's right
and I --
Yeah .
-- I 've seen some of them like that too
and also they have a lot of , uh , activities going on for the ones --
Uh-huh .
-- who are more active .
Yeah .
Sh- ,
So it 's not sort of like , uh , uh --
Uh-huh .
-- a sick place .
No ,
she loves it .
She has a great social life
and she travels
and , uh , it 's in , in the very in the mountains
and it 's beautiful
and , uh , I , I hope that I have something like that when I get older .
Yeah
I , I think , I think the , uh --
Uh-huh .
-- I think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the , uh , elderly --
Uh-huh .
-- uh , person who 's going in and the family that 's going to be , uh , effec , effected by it --
Oh definitely it 's ,
-- and , uh , you know , sometimes it can , those choi- , those choices can be made in advance
and sometimes --
Right .
-- the choices because of the nature of the illness when they 're ,
So , uh , do you happen to be working for a large firm ?
Well , it 's about three hundred and fifty people .
I guess that 's not large compared to some ,
but it 's big enough .
Uh-huh .
And they have a , they do n't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything
and I wish they did .
Yeah .
You know , they have a four O one K ,
but I put all the money into it .
Uh-huh .
They do n't add anything .
What about you ?
Uh , I work for a fairly large company .
It 's got eight thousand people .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , we do have health insurance .
We do n't have four O k- , one K plan , stuff like that ,
but we do have , like , retirement .
They kind of match up to , you ,
if you put six percent , they match up to six percent ,
and then the rest is whatever you want to put in . If you put more than that or something like that .
Oh , that 's a pretty good deal .
It 's not bad .
Now , how long does it take for your contribution to vest ?
God , I do n't know .
It 's probably a long time .
I 'm sure it 's not till like twenty-five years , thirty years .
Yeah ,
the place I work at 's , health insurance is kind of expensive .
It 's like hundred bucks a , a month or something --
Yeah .
-- for a family .
Huh , well , I guess what we have is like a f- , what they call a flex benefits plan where you , you get like a certain amount of dollars
and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need .
Otherwise you can , uh , guess you can put , also put money , hold money back and then either use or lose it and that does n't get taxed or can just have that money , you know , put in your paycheck .
Yeah ,
we have one of those use it or lose it plans , too , where , uh , they 'll basically pay for , uh , you know , child care type , uh , expenses .
I can send in a , uh , can send in a request for payment
and they 'll , uh , and they 'll send me , you know a check for the amount they withheld .
That 's pretty good , you know .
It 's , uh , it saves a third off on taxes or something .
Yeah ,
well , it depends on which company you work for .
I know that , like , the , the , the one plan that everyone seems to be in , in my place is , uh , you know , you , uh , think you call it plan D .
Deductibles are really high ,
it 's like fifteen hundred dollars ,
but if you go for the other ones you 're paying too much money for them because it 's unlikely , if you 're f- , relatively , uh , healthy , then it 's really unlikely that you 'd use that much , amount of money , you know .
So , the- , it , you know , someone did start a cost benefit analysis ,
and ends up the best is to take a high deductible and , and take a loss , what , whatever it happens to be , if you happen to be a healthy individual .
Yeah ,
I guess ,
uh , on the other hand , you know , I , I had a similar , had a similar health plan
and , uh , one of my kids was in a car accident
and , uh --
Um .
-- I had , wound up having to pay for , you know , a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of , you know , no , no insurance policy happened to cover it , which is ,
Really ?
You mean , not even your , your , your car insurance ?
Well , it , it got all screwed up because I had a high deductible on the health insurance , no fault here ,
and , and I had a high deductible on the on the , uh , on the c- , car insurance
and then s- , you know , we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and blew it .
Oh , that 's too bad .
Oh , well .
Yeah ,
uh , well , I do n't know ,
I think other than health insurance , I think , uh , you know , an extra week of , uh , time off would be nice .
I only get two weeks .
Yeah ,
yeah
my place you get two weeks when you start
and then every , every year they give you an extra day until you 've got four weeks .
Oh , that 's nice .
We do n't get them till , till your seventh year of service till --
Aye .
-- you get an extra week .
That 's a long time .
Yeah ,
it 's , uh ,
Yeah ,
especially in the kind of engineering job I 'm in , you know , companies do n't stay afloat that long ,
and , and they ,
Uh , with the telecommunications type of company , supposedly you , used to be much more stable .
It 's a lot less stable than it used to be .
They used to have job security crap ,
but now they do n't .
So you work for Bell or something like that ?
Yeah ,
it 's the Bell Corps , which is , uh ,
Right .
Yeah .
Right .
So , I do n't know ,
it 's , it 's , uh , no longer .
So that 's what ,
I think it 's still based on the old model of ,
and , and now they do n't , uh ,
A lifelong job security
telephone --
Yeah .
-- pioneers of America ,
all that stuff , huh .
Yeah ,
but they , no , no longer .
.
I do n't think so .
Right .
Uh , hearing a lo- ,
there 's always , they 're always laying people off , which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security .
Is it , I mean , does it ,
they must have pretty good severance , though , huh ?
Oh , I do n't know ,
we do n't , we have n't been doing layoffs .
We 've been doing , uh , down sizing with , uh , getting rid of extra layers of management .
And , uh , I do n't know what they do for those people .
Mean the , the , the management they get rid of ?
Some of it ,
yeah .
Um .
There 's too many manage , too many chiefs and not enough Indians
but ,
Oh , they , they put ,
Well , have you ever served on a jury ?
No ,
I 've not .
I 've been called ,
but I had to beg off from the duty .
And you ?
Well , I was called
and then I was not chosen .
Um .
Well , I was , I was , uh , originally chosen primarily , I think , because I was a young fellow
and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict .
I do n't know why .
Something I picked up in a psychology class some time ago .
Oh , really ?
Yeah ,
it 's that the younger they are , they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason ,
and they kind of liked me .
I looked conser , and all that stuff
and they ,
I do n't know what they saw in me ,
but they saw it .
But , uh , back to the issue , is , uh ,
I do n't know ,
at times I feel that a unanimous decision is warranted , especially in cases in which there 's no smoking gun .
But , there , too , there are also cases in which I feel a majority rule might be acceptable , particularly , I think in civil cases .
In criminal cases , I 'd like to see the unani- , unanimity remain ,
but in civil cases , I think a majority rule by , by jury would be sufficient .
Well , uh , could you give me an example of a case where you think that ?
Well , in a criminal case , say one in which , you know , there is , like , say assault or some such . I think there ought to be a unanimous , uh , vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this .
And in civil law there , you know , is such a thing as like , let 's say , uh , misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that .
A majority rule , I think , would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases .
I do n't know if I 'm making any sense or not .
Well , I mean , I think ,
are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more , uh , tangible
or ,
Yeah ,
often there 's more incriminating evidence .
Like , for instance , say , uh ,
and also , too , I think I 'm , I 'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more , uh , serious in a criminal case .
Well , do you think that , that in a civil case , if there was majority rule , that it would be easy for someone to be set up ?
Um , well , I really ca n't say for certain , truth be known .
Uh , as it stands , there 's , there 's many ways and means by which a person can be set up , both , uh , in a civil , uh , civil and criminal case .
I mean , the , uh , documentary , the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that .
You know , I do n't know for , if you 're familiar with that or not .
No ,
I 'm not .
A , uh , fellow when he was much younger , uh , was tried and convicted and sentenced to death .
Fortunately , in his case , the death penalty was revoked
and , uh , so he served out his , his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system .
The case was reopened
and he was exonerated .
Well , I mean , I think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served .
Yeah ,
many laws , but little justice .
Say ,
but , uh ,
and I also think , just like you were talking about before , why you were chosen to be on a jury that , uh , the , just , the process of picking jurors is not always objective .
Oh , certainly not ,
certainly not .
And , you know , they like to think that they 're getting someone who 's objective in all this ,
but they 're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers ' desires .
You know , the ,
because you get up
and , and they ask you a few questions ,
both sides do ,
and then you , you 're either challenged which is ,
you know , each attorney can use that as much as they like
or , I think it 's a limit now ,
they probably have a limit now ,
but , they pretty much go through that ,
and then you have to give a reason to the court why you ca n't serve .
For me , it was financial hardship ,
so . But , onto the thing , uh , I was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing .
It was always my impression that the Justice himself , or herself , had the final say .
Okay ,
so I guess it starts recording now .
Okay .
Okay .
I do n't know , really know that much about the recycling in this area that we 're in .
We live in the Saginaw area .
Saginaw ?
Uh-huh .
And I 'm not real familiar with , uh , anything that ,
I ,
fact as far as I know , the school does n't have any kind of programs or anything out here . And , uh , or the grocery store or anything --
Really ?
-- in this area ,
yeah .
The rec- ,
we live in Plano
and they started off recycling by , uh , putting the ,
I think at each Wal-Mart , they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that , which now ,
I guess the , uh , city is , has bought the big green trash cans
and , uh , we , they have a recycling truck that comes around now
and you separate your glass and paper --
Uh-huh .
-- and , uh , aluminum
and you set it out
and they pick it up
and it , it works real neat .
They seem to be having a real good response .
Really ?
So ,
That is pretty good .
I 'm , we 're originally from another state
and I know in the state we were from that they did that t- , similar type thing .
The city brought ought , you know , set tr- , separate trash cans
and you separated your stuff
and you put it in there
and they took it , you know .
Did they , did they , like on bottles , did they give you a so many cents back for --
I do n't really know .
-- for cans
even or ,
I do n't really know ,
they , they started after we moved down here
and so --
Yeah .
-- I , I 'm not really familiar .
I just know that , uh , my in-laws up in , up in Oklahoma , that 's how they do , you know , they pick it up ,
but I do n't know if they get a , get anything back on it
or , do you get money for it ?
No ,
I just , I noticed it
Iowa and other cities like that , it 's a nickel per aluminum can .
Oh .
So you do n't see too many thrown out around the streets .
Really .
Or even bottles .
.
You know , all kinds of bottles they , they , they really charge people to , I guess when you purchase them and , and then when you turn them back in .
Right .
I n- , I remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel .
Right .
And now , now most of them are throwaway .
Right .
.
So , maybe that 's one thing they can do .
I think now they 're a lot more expensive than that .
Uh , I bought some Cokes the other day in the br- , the little bottles --
Uh-huh .
-- you know ,
and I think the bottles were like , I know they were at least ten cents apiece .
I started to see , at home ,
I was like , God , how much were those bottles you know ?
-
Yes .
And , it was , they come in like , uh , eight and , and eight and ten packs , you know --
Right .
-- instead of six packs
and , uh , and they were like , it was like two dollars and something for the bottles .
You know , I was like God Almighty ,
it costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes .
That was my brother 's first job in a grocery store .
He was in the bottle area .
In the bot- , MUMBLEx .
It 's pretty dangerous out there , you know , when they fall over ,
but --
Right .
-- but it 's , uh , it 's quite ,
they say that the green glass now , that there 's a big glut --
Oh , really ?
-- of green --
Of green glass .
-- the green glass ,
yeah .
It 's amazing .
Well , out in this area , they really do n't have anything .
Now , I know that like Minyard 's --
Uh-huh .
-- and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores , they have like four different bins out front .
Right .
Uh , different colors for different things and , and things like that ,
but I , I do know some of these places were doing that
and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them .
Right .
.
Yeah
it 's ,
I notice the plastic have sort of faded away , the milk jugs .
Yeah .
It , it 's ,
people just ,
they , they really do n't ,
uh , there 's too much labor involved I guess to separate the stuff .
Yeah ,
more than it 's worth .
It 's ,
I do n't know ,
it , it can be ,
it 's not as easy ,
.
selecting , you know , clean junk as they say .
Right .
Well , who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away .
That 's right ,
that 's right .
It 's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher .
Right ,
uh , yeah .
We all do it .
.
Well , it was nice talking to you .
It was nice talking to you .
I have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything .
Oh , I think , I think two or three minutes is --
I- ,
-- fine .
Is that it ?
Yeah .
Okay ,
well , it was nice talking to you
and I , I guess I 'll do this for , I was doing this for , actually , I was going to do it for my son so that he could , uh , he , he 's in high school , so that he could make some money .
Right .
Uh , but then it has my name on it ,
so I 'm like , okay ,
I 'll sit down here and call it .
Well , we 're doing it for a church choir
so ,
Oh , are you ?
Yeah .
Oh , that 's interesting .
So ,
That 's nice .
Well ,
Well , thank you .
Thank you .
Bye .
Bye-bye .
So . Have you heard about Saturns ?
I 've heard some about Saturns .
I do n't know a lot about them .
I have n't been over , uh , to a dealer to look at them although I did see something in tonight 's paper that said that their , uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the , I guess , the Japanese cars .

Ooh , that 's great .
Actually that 's kind of the type of car that I , I 'm thinking about we might get .
Saturns , you ca n't go to a dealer unless you go to a , a Saturn dealer .
Uh-huh .
This , this offshoot of G M .
Yeah .
And , uh , supposedly , they 've got great customer satisfaction from what things I 've heard .
Um . Yeah ,
I 've heard a lot of people like them .
Uh , yet I do n't know wh- , whether I would buy Saturn or not at this point .
I 'm kind of ,
my card and , uh , desires tend to be pretty picky
and so , uh .
Well , like what ?
Well , let 's see .
I li , I like cars that are designed with , with human beings in mind ,
.
and that 's not just the driver and the passenger
but that 's the person who 's working on it ,
cause I do al- , almost all my own maintenance and , uh --
Uh-huh .
-- those types of things .
And I found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in , uh , finding a ca- , car anymore that 's , that 's fairly easy for me to work on , it 's just not very eas , it 's not very ,
almost unlikely at this point .
Yeah .
And , uh , yo- ,
Yeah .
I 've got a sixty-five Mustang
and --
Ooh .
-- I , and I do the work on , most of the work on that myself .
Uh-huh .
And when I look at modern cars and stuff like that , I just say I will never do that with the modern cars .
It 's not worth my time .
You ca n't get in there .
You ca n't do anything .
Yeah .
And it 's so complicated too .
I look at it
and I say , boy , you know ,
I , I 'd have to almost go take a class or something like that .
Well I 've got an eighty-three Saab .
Uh-huh .
And I find that for a normal , you know , everyday things . It 's really very easy to work on
and so , uh , you know , I 'm kind of spoiled .
I used to have a MUMBLEx Chevy .
Uh-huh .
With a three fifty in it .
Yeah .
And , uh , I really liked working on it . Uh , cause it was pretty easy too .
It was about a nineteen seventy .
So I 'm kind of , uh , biased in that
and , you know , I want a car that I can work on because I think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore .
Yeah .
And that 's kind of , that 's , that 's probably one thing I 'd look at .
I think another thing I 'd look at is safety .
Yeah .
That 's one of the things that my wife and I have thought about .
Actually , the car , one of the cars we 'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one Ford Taurus cause they 're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual --
Huh .
-- side air bags .
That 's a real nice car , I think .
Yeah .
I 've driven some , uh , Tauruses over the last couple of years when I 've been on business trips .
Uh-huh .
Uh , as rental cars .
And I 've always been very impressed with the Taurus .
It 's a really nice car .
I think it 's very , it 's a stylish car both inside and out .
It 's comfortable to drive .
Uh , reasonable performance ,
and this is out in California where , where they do n't make a car that 's got reasonable performance anymore .
Yeah .
Uh , I 've been real impressed with that .
Yo- ,
and I did n't realize that they were putting dual , uh , air bags in that car now .
Ninety ,
yeah .
Or , excuse me , the ninety-twos .
The --
Uh-huh .
-- ninety-twos had dual air bags .
This newest model .
You could --
Oh , I think that ,
-- get them with duals .
That 's excellent .
That 's excellent because ,
Yeah .
But the thing is that it 's twenty thousand dollars .
Actually , my , my wife and I are actually thinking , contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so .
So we 're actually --
Oh .
-- been looking around and thinking about things .
We 'd like to get like a
oh , I do n't know .
What do you call it ?
A dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know .
Uh-huh .
Year old ninety-two or something like that .
Uh-huh .
Sure .
Those are --
See if we ,
-- yeah ,
that , that would be a good deal to go with .
And the other thing we 're looking at is the Saturns too .
Okay .
Because they looked really nice .
Uh-huh .
What do you , what do you looking for in , in those ?
What , what attracts you to the Saturns ?
Or , or , of course , we 've already talked , you know ,
the Taurus is safe .
But wh , what kind of things are you looking for ?
Well , the Saturns you can get air bags in them .
I do n't think you can get dual side air bags .
Uh-huh .
But one of the , the two things that I 'm really ,
the , the I 'd say the most important thing is a car that 's not going to fall apart . That does n't have problems .
Uh-huh .
You set down .
You look at consumer reports .
We 've been pouring over consumer reports
and you just get so depressed for the U S auto --
Yeah .
-- makers when you do that .
Because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have
and , and the two cars that apparently are close to that . That actually have high reliability , the Taurus is one of the highest U S cars .
Uh-huh .
And the other one is , are the Saturns .
Uh-huh .
So those two things .
And then , you know , we kind of want a four door .
Okay .
Okay .
What is your , uh , community , uh , currently doing with regard to recycling ?
Uh , basically , they 're just , uh , having various recycling , uh , bins , uh , located for , uh , trash pickup .
Uh-huh .
Well that 's more than we have up here in Massachusetts .
Some , some local communities are very active in that , uh , in that respect
and they do have bins set up .
But I live in a , a metropolitan area
and , uh , they 're not , uh , too inclined to do something as aggressive as that .
Well , here they and ,
uh , live in an apartment complex .
Uh-huh .
And they only have one set of recycling bins , one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters .
So a lot of the people who live up front do n't bother to recycle because , you know , it 's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins .
I , I know a lot , I think a lot of , uh , the , the issues with regard to recycling are that , uh , people have to be motivated to do , to do something like that because it does take extra effort .
Whether
and , and I think that , and I know Massachusetts has ,
a bottle bill was passed
and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now ,
and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably , believe it or not , is just to get the extra nickel at the , uh , the store and not , uh ,
that 's the majority of people that I know of anyways .
Where people are n't really , you know , eco conscious . It 's just the fact that it 's something they have to do .
And I 'm not going to throw a bottle away ,
it 's like throwing a nickel away .
That type of thing .
Right .
They ,
But , uh , people need to be more conscious of it .
Th- , here they 're trying to push through a bill
and a lot of people are against it .
And it 's going to create a lot more work for the , uh , the stores that sell , you know , sodas and stuff .
Because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything .
Yeah .
MUMBLEx It did n't , it , it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans .
Uh , and , and matter of fact , I think it took like three tries t- , for it to go through .
But , and it 's been pretty successful
and people notice it as far as , uh , highways being , uh , you know ,
people would dr , have a drink of soda ,
instead of throwing out the window , they , they keep the bottle
so it 's , it 's been a ecologically sound policy and , you know , as , as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth .
But more importantly , it 's recycling reusable materials back into , uh , manufacturing .
And that 's the big thing , I think , that th , they try to promote .
Right .
I think here if they , uh , instead of just , you know , requiring that you put , put out the trash and stuff , if they could get some kind of rebate , those people who do put the stuff out , uh , you know , and separate it , have lower collection fee or something may --
Yeah ,
that 's a good idea .
-- encourage --
Yeah .
-- people to separate .
Th- , there definitely has to be a motivation factor
and I know that , at w , where I work ,
I work for a defense contractor .
And there 's a big push on for recycling , uh , paper materials , you know , computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of , uh , Styrofoam usage because of the , uh , the process involved in Styrofoam and , and the whole eco issue and that .
And , and they 're very proactive
and , uh , matter of fact , they give you discounts if you use , uh , china wear rather than , uh , Styrofoam stuff ,
so . So , i- , i- , it 's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it .
I think that 's , that 's what they need to do . Be more proactive like that .
Uh , I know , uh , I believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books .
Uh , usually have them come from MUMBLEx you know , projects to collect old ones .
Usually just get dumped out with the trash .
And phone books are a large volume of annual trash .
Yeah .
They , they just ,
matter of fact , that , that reminded me of an article I saw in the pa- ,
the local schools , you could send your phone book to your , uh , to , with your kid to school
and what they 'll do is they 'll recycle it .
Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that , uh , trash , uh , the telephone books are the type of thing that do n't break down over a long period of time .
A guy went to a d- , a landfill , dug down five feet and , and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty
because they do n't , they do n't degrade over such a period of time .
Well , part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper .
Yeah .
They contain the glue and stuff
and they used to have to take out all the , uh , pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them .
Yeah .
Now I think they 've come up with some way of , uh , pulling the glue out .
Yeah .
Okay .
Uh , let 's see .
How about , uh , let 's see , about ten years ago ,
uh , what do you think was different ten years ago from now ?
Well , I would say as , far as social changes go , uh , I think families were more together .
They , they did more things together .
Uh-huh .
Uh , they ate dinner at the table together .
Uh , the parents usually took out time , uh , you know , more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity .
Uh-huh .
Uh , although I 'm not a mother , I , I still think that , uh , a lot has changed since ten years ago .
Uh , what do you --
We ,
-- think about that ?
Well , uh , actually ten years from today seems rather short .
Yeah .
Uh , but I do agree that , uh , generally it 's , society has sort of , uh , let 's see , rushed everything ahead .
Uh-huh .
And , uh , I do n't know ,
it leaves , leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that .
In other words , they just prioritize their lives differently .
But I think that has a lot to do with economic situation .
Yes .
What about like as far as , uh , social changes in the individual ?
Do --
Uh ,
-- you think that the individual has as much time as they did , let 's say , ten , twenty years ago ?
Um . It depends .
Uh , it 's hard to say because I think people were busy ten twenty years ago too .
Uh-huh .
Uh , I just ,
Well , how , how old are you ?
I 'm twenty-eight .
Twenty-eight .
Okay ,
I 'm twenty-three .
Yeah .
So there 's maybe a five year gap between us .
Yeah .
So , uh .
I just , I think that things were a bit , were , have been busy all along .
It 's just --
Huh .
-- a matter where priorities are , at placed .
Yes .
And that , uh , usually as far as families are concerned , there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home .
Uh-huh .
And now , uh , it 's pretty much an economic necessity of , for most , in most places for both parents to work .
Do you think it 's an economic c- , necessity
or do you think that we 're , we 're , uh , all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living ?
I think that 's part of it too .
But I do think ,
I mean do you think ,
.
people really need two cars and --
No ,
no .
I do n't .
-- a house in the suburbs or ,
No ,
I do n't think that .
But then there are a lot of people that , that do n't have that .
Uh-huh .
But , that really do need to work .
Uh-huh .
I think maybe those people that really do need to work , both parents , just to survive .
And --
Yeah .
-- then there , th- , is , is that other group that is --
Uh-huh .
-- working to maintain a standard of living --
Okay .
-- that , uh , they think is , is surviving which is really more luxuries .
Uh-huh .
Uh , but I I tend to think that it 's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive .
Yo- , so you think it 's ,
which group are you saying is the one trying ?
I 'm saying that the , uh , the group that is just trying to survive from day to day , where both parents are working --
Uh-huh .
-- is more of the majority than the , than the people that have the higher standard of living .
Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing , uh , middle class in this country --
Uh-huh .
-- I think that that 's , in my opinion , the case .
Okay .
So .
I mean I have met people that , uh , both that , that just want to maintain a , the standard of living and those that , that really need the job .
Okay .
And then , sometimes I , I often , uh , find that maybe there 's so many different things available to us . Yo- , a microwave , a V C R , a answering machine --
Uh-huh .
-- a , you know , a special , a dishwasher , uh , a refrigerator and some of those items , um , for the , for the , uh ,
well I guess we 're sticking more to social changes
but , uh --
Uh-huh .
-- people want all of that
and not all of those are necessities .
Right .
So they 're trying to ,
it has become a necessity .
Okay .
I say they , uh ,
probably the best things to do is , is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water
if they sink --
I see .
